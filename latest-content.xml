  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>It was during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, when citizens in many countries around the world were confined to their homes, that Andrea Saltelli and colleagues were inspired to write “a manifesto for responsible modelling.” The television news was, Saltelli recalls, dominated by models of Covid infections, hospitalisations, and deaths. Politicians pointed to charts showing those model projections and spoke of “flattening the curve” – driving down case numbers – so as not to overwhelm healthcare systems.</p>
<p>While all this was going on, Saltelli came into contact “with a fantastic group of people,” he says, “all of whom were, in a sense, concerned by the sudden eruption of mathematical modelling into everyday life.”</p>
<p>“We were concerned that this [modelling] was not being done properly, that too much importance was given to those numbers, too much certainty was attached to them, and nobody seemed to realise that the selection of certain numbers rather than others would eventually and dramatically bias the message that was given.”</p>
<p>In June 2020, Saltelli – along with Monica Di Fiore, Deborah Mayo, Theodore Porter, Philip Stark and others – published in <em>Nature</em> their manifesto setting out “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01812-9">Five ways to ensure that models serve society</a>.” The ideas proposed in that three-page comment piece have now been given a book-length treatment, so we sat down with Saltelli to discuss <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-politics-of-modelling-9780198872412?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Politics of Modelling: Numbers Between Science and Policy</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell our readers a little about yourself?</strong><br>
I am a chemist. I got my degree in chemistry, but for most of my life I have worked as a mathematical modeller and applied statistician. More recently, let’s say in the last 10 years or so, I have also moved into issues of epistemology – meaning, how do we decide that we know what we know, and how do we do that when the source of the knowledge is represented by a mathematical model?</p>
<p><strong>I’d like to dig into the title of your new book. What should people understand about <em>The Politics of Modelling</em>?</strong><br>
It starts from a broader discussion of a state of exception enjoyed by mathematical modelling. One point we try to make in the book is that models are exceptional because they have an incredible palette of methodologies – even more than statistics. They are not a discipline, because everyone does modelling in their own craft in a different way. Modelling even escapes the gaze of sociologists most of the time because sociologists are more interested in algorithms and statistics. And, as a consequence of this state of exception, models enjoy many privileges, including a better defence of the pretence of neutrality, and they maintain, in a certain sense, a lapse of symmetry between developers and users. They also have a very strong grip on policy, whereby models can enjoy a high epistemic authority, and this epistemic authority seems to be proportional to the dimension of the model or the base of data on which the model has been calibrated. All of this creates a situation which leads to a problem – a problem for society, on the one hand, because models are used to suggest policies which are not optimal, and on the other hand, trust is consumed, trust is lost, and this may have been happening as a result of the Covid-19 epidemic and the way mathematical modelling was used in the context of the epidemic.</p>
<p><strong>The book emerged out of the “manifesto for responsible modelling” that you published in <em>Nature</em> a few years back. Could you describe that manifesto?</strong><br>
The manifesto was something which came out of the pandemic, in fact, because we were all locked up at home and we could spend some time reflecting and writing. We tried to produce a set of recommendations for both society and the modellers: for society to be a bit more circumspect in accepting results from mathematical modelling, and for modellers to be more cautious in formulating their predictions. But, beyond the issue of apparent precision of mathematical models, there was also the issue that models are built on a series of assumptions, each of which may have a great bearing on the result. And not only that but also, at the point where you formulate a mathematical model, you assume that you have already decided what is the problem, what is the direction of progress. So, there are really many normative assumptions which are embedded into that. Then there is the issue that mathematical models are not done by everyone; they are done by specific groups of people who belong to, normally, a certain identified class, some kind of elite – not a financial elite, but an elite in terms of competencies and knowledge. And this also creates bias, because – to put it brutally – if you can work at home with your laptop, the epidemic doesn’t affect you so much. But if you work in a plant and the plant is closed, and you are not paid, this destroys your life, or the life of your family. This asymmetry – or inequality, let’s say, or implicit bias – in those who are producing the analysis, this was, for many of us, an issue which needed to be brought to the attention of the public.</p>

<p>The manifesto was something which came out of the pandemic… We tried to produce a set of recommendations for both society and the modellers: for society to be a bit more circumspect in accepting results from mathematical modelling, and for modellers to be more cautious in formulating their predictions.</p>

<p><strong>Surely the urgency of the Covid situation prevented people from taking a step back and thinking more deeply about how models are constructed. Is it not forgivable in a situation like that? Or, is your argument that we should be doing this at all times, regardless of the urgency, regardless of the time pressures?</strong><br>
I am tempted to say both yes and no. Yes, because surely the situation was urgent, and many things which were done in a way which one would consider suboptimal were later justified on the grounds of urgency. We noted incredible differences in the measures adopted in several countries, so for us it was obvious that even though everyone was claiming to “follow the science,” they seemed to be following different sciences, or perhaps they were following “the science” which was more instrumental or more convenient to justify what was simply politically expedient.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I would say: it’s always urgent, no? We are very often in these kinds of situations. One might say that even the regulation of artificial intelligence today is urgent. Regulation of pesticides is urgent. Not to mention geopolitics… Everything seems to be urgent, and this seems to be a constant in our relationship with technology in particular: we don’t want to kill innovation, but if we wait to see what a new piece of technology does before we regulate it, then maybe it’s too late to change it. This is exploited by many people, not least [Mark] Zuckerberg [CEO of Facebook owner Meta]. He says, “Move fast and break things,” but once things are broken, they’re broken.</p>
<p>And talking about things being broken, what we discuss in the book is also this issue of broken trust. People are losing faith in expertise – not in all countries in the same way; there are national differences that are important. But, in general, if you measure trust in science – which is still very high – it’s taken quite a dent during the pandemic, and we argue that this was in part due to abuse of mathematical models.</p>
<p><strong>The book, which you’ve edited with Monica Di Fiore, breaks down the manifesto for responsible modelling into extended essays from different contributors, looking at different aspects of modelling – the framing of models, the assumptions, the consequences. For these essays, you draw on experts from different fields: sociology, philosophy, statistics, civil engineering, geography, law, environmental sciences, and others. Why was it important to get such diverse perspectives on these various aspects of modelling?</strong><br>
There is a major divide between social science – humanities – on the one hand and natural sciences on the other hand, with lots of suspicion between the two fields and sometimes open hostility. Mathematical modelling is particularly impenetrable, as we argue, to the gaze coming from a social scientist – at least, more impenetrable than statistics or algorithms, which have been very much studied in recent years. And so, it was important to allow the two fields, the two big communities, to communicate and to speak to one another in a critical way.</p>
<p><strong>You write in your introduction to the book that the field of statistics has spent more time thinking more deeply about questions of data ethics, model assumptions, and so on. Can you give an example?</strong><br>
There is a book by a group of French statisticians, <em>Statactivisme</em>, which is rich with examples of how a statistician could make a difference by simply producing better numbers. They don’t say, “Throw away the model, throw away the numbers,” but simply be careful of what numbers you use. And I think models and modellers need something like this, some kind of systematic debate – a societal debate – with other disciplines on what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>One of the quotes that jumped out at me from the book was, “Models are underexplained but overinterpreted.” How do we reset that balance?</strong><br>
This is more easily said than done. The remedies to this are, maybe we should spend some time thinking about reproducibility, even in mathematical modelling. This is not done. We talk about the reproducibility of data but very few people talk about the reproducibility of a mathematical model. Another thing which I think would be useful is to think more about how to interpret models and less about how to make them bigger. And then, of course, there is the practice of “assumption hunting.” If you use a model, go and hunt for the assumptions contributing to its construction.</p>
<p>To the modellers we say, engage yourself in something that might be called “modelling of the model process,” which means, try to imagine what would happen if you took a different branch in the construction of the model. In this we make an analogy to the “garden of the forking paths,” something that statisticians discuss, because they understand that when they build a statistical construction, they can take one way or another way, and when they measure the impact of taking a different path – as, for instance, when they give the same data to different teams – they find an amazing diversity of results that are totally unexpected. We are learning now that not only in statistics and mathematical modelling but in the laboratory, too – conducting physical experiments, not numerical ones – you can have a diverging set of outcomes depending on who is doing the analysis.</p>
<p>All this should call for a science that is more humble – one that accepts this kind of possibility and works actively to make these issues evident but also solves them in order to produce knowledge that is useful.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier, you spoke about modellers coming from a specific group or class of people – an elite. We interviewed, earlier this year, <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2023/01/25/erica-thompson.html">Erica Thompson</a>, author of the book <em>Escape from Model Land</em>, and one of the points Erica discussed was how to bring more diversity of thought and of voices into the modelling process. How do we engage broader communities in the construction of models – maybe not building the model itself, but thinking about what is important, what needs to be measured, what are we looking to understand?</strong><br>
This could be achieved if models were used in a context of what we, the authors, call an “extended peer community.” In other words, this is the idea that when you are discussing an issue, you should talk to the people directly affected by the issue because they have some knowledge about it. For this to take place, the model must be one instrument, which the community can get together to discuss, and so the model must not be too complex.</p>
<p><strong>Now that your book is out, what do you hope will be its impact?</strong><br>
Looking from the point of view of the modellers, I would like them to be more humble and less ambitious in developing monster models that are impossible to inspect and explore. From society I would like to see a more circumspect attitude, as I said before. Society has been trained to be sceptical of statistical information, but we should also be circumspect about the output of mathematical modelling. Ask more questions; ask, for instance, for the uncertainty range for a given number, or whether the number tells the entire story.</p>

  <title>Deduplicating and linking large datasets using Splink</title>
  <dc:creator>Robin Linacre</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In 2019, the data linking team at the Ministry of Justice was challenged to develop a new data linking methodology to produce new, higher quality linked datasets from the justice system.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal was to share new linked datasets with academic researchers, as part of the ADR UK-funded <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ministry-of-justice-data-first">Data First programme</a>. These datasets – which include data from prisons, probation, and the criminal and family courts – are now available, and researchers can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/moj-data-first-application-form-for-secure-access-to-data">apply for secure access</a>.</p>
<p>The linking methodology is widely applicable and has been published as a free and open source software package called <a href="https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink">Splink</a>. The software applies statistical best practice to accurately and quickly link and deduplicate large datasets. The software has now been downloaded over 7 million times, and has been used widely in government, academia and the private sector.</p>
<section id="the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>Data duplication is a ubiquitous problem affecting data quality. Organisations often have multiple records that refer to the same entity but no unique identifier that ties these entities together. Data entry errors and other issues mean that variations usually exist, so the records belonging to a single entity aren’t necessarily identical.</p>
<p>For example, in a company, customer data may have been entered multiple times in multiple different databases, with different spellings of names, different addresses, and other typos. The inability to identify which records belong to each customer presents a data quality problem at all stages of data analysis – from basic questions such as counting the number of unique customers, through to advanced statistical analysis.</p>
<p>With the growing size of datasets held by many organisations, any solution must be able to work on very large datasets of tens of millions of records or more.</p>
</section>
<section id="approach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>In collaboration with academic experts, the team started with desk research into data linking theory and practice, and a review of existing open source software implementations.</p>
<p>One of the most common theoretical approaches described in the literature is the Fellegi-Sunter model. This statistical model has a long history of application for high profile, important record linking tasks such as in the US Census Bureau and the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p>
<p>The model takes pairwise comparisons of records as an input, and outputs a match score between 0 and 1, which (loosely) can be interpreted as the probability of the two records being a match. Since the record comparison can be either two records from the same dataset, or records from different datasets, this is applicable to both deduplication and linkage problems.</p>
<p>An important benefit of the model is explainability. The model uses a number of parameters, each of which <a href="https://www.robinlinacre.com/partial_match_weights/">has an intuitive explanation</a> that can be understood by a non-technical audience. The relative simplicity of the model also means it is easier to understand and explain how biases in linkage may occur, such as varying levels of accuracy for different ethnic groups.</p>
<section id="example" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Consider the following simple record comparison. Are these records a match?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/11/22/images/record_comparison.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Colour coded comparison of two records.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The parameters of the model are known as partial match weights, which capture the strength of the evidence in favour or against these records being a match.</p>
<p>They can be represented in a chart as follows, in which the highlighted bars correspond to the above example record comparison:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/11/22/images/partial_match_weights.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Chart showing partial match weights of model.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We can see, for example, that the first name (Robin vs Robyn) is not an exact match, but they have a Jaro-Winkler similarity of above 0.9. As a result, the model ‘activates’ the corresponding partial match weight (in orange). This lends some evidence in favour of a match, but the partial match weight is not as strong as it would have been for an exact match.</p>
<p>Similarly we can see that the non-match on gender leads to the activation (in purple) of a strong negative partial match weight.</p>
<p>The activated partial match weight can then be represented in a waterfall chart as follows, which shows how the final match score is calculated:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/11/22/images/waterfall.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Waterfall chart showing how partial match weights combine to calculate the final prediction.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The parameter estimates in these charts all have intuitive explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The partial match weight on first name is positive, but relatively weak. This makes sense, because the first names are a fuzzy match, not an exact match, so this provides only moderate evidence in favour of the record being a match.</li>
<li>The match weight for the exact match on postcode is stronger than the equivalent weight for surname. This is because the cardinality of the postcode field in the underlying data is higher than the cardinality for surname, so matches on postcode are less likely to occur by chance than matches on surname.</li>
<li>The negative match weight for the mismatch on gender is relatively strong. This reflects the fact that, in this dataset, it’s uncommon for the ‘gender’ field to match amongst truly matching records.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final result is that the model predicts these records are a match, but with only 94% probability: it’s not sure. Most examples would be less ambiguous than this one, and would have a match probability very close to either 0 or 1.</p>
<p>For further details of the theory behind the Fellegi-Sunter model, and a deep dive into the intuitive explanations of the model, I have have developed a <a href="https://www.robinlinacre.com/intro_to_probabilistic_linkage/">series of interactive tutorials</a>.</p>

<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Through our desk research and open source software review, an existing software package called <a href="https://github.com/kosukeimai/fastLink">fastLink</a> was identified which implements the Fellegi-Sunter model, but unfortunately the software is not able to handle very large datasets of more than a few hundred thousand records.</p>
<p>Inspired by the popularity of fastLink, the team quickly realised that the methodology it was developing was generally applicable and could be valuable to a wide range of users if published as a software package.</p>
<p>As we spoke to colleagues across government and beyond, we found record linkage and deduplication problems are pervasive, and crop up in many different guises, meaning that any software needed to be very general and flexible.</p>
<p>The result is Splink – which is a Python package that implements the Fellegi-Sunter model, and enables parameters to be estimated using the Expectation Maximisation algorithm.</p>
<p>The package is free to use, <a href="https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink">and open source</a>. It is accompanied by <a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/index.html">detailed documentation</a>, including a <a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/demos/tutorials/00_Tutorial_Introduction.html">tutorial</a> and a set of <a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/demos/examples/examples_index.html">examples</a>.</p>
<p>Splink makes no assumptions about the type of entity being linked, so it is very flexible. We are aware of its use to match data on a variety of entity types including persons, companies, financial transactions and court cases.</p>
<p>The package closely follows the statistical approach described in fastLink. In particular it implements the same mathematical model and likelihood functions described in the <a href="http://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/linkage.pdf">fastLink paper</a> (see pages 354 to 357), with a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure correctness of the implementation.</p>
<p>In addition, Splink introduces a number of innovations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Able to work at massive scale – with proven examples of its use on over 100 million records.</li>
<li>Extremely fast – capable of linking 1 million records on a laptop in around a minute.</li>
<li><a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/charts/index.html">Comprehensive graphical output</a> showing parameter estimates and iteration history make it easier to understand the model and diagnose statistical issues.</li>
<li><a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/charts/waterfall_chart.html">A waterfall chart</a> which can be generated for any record pair, which explains how the estimated match probability is derived.</li>
<li>Support for deduplication, linking, and a combination of both, including support for deduplicating and linking multiple datasets.</li>
<li>Greater customisability of record comparisons, including the ability <a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/topic_guides/comparisons/customising_comparisons.html">to specify custom, user defined comparison functions.</a></li>
<li>Term frequency adjustments on any number of columns.</li>
<li>It’s possible to save a model once it’s been estimated – enabling a model to be estimated, quality assured, and then reused as new data becomes available.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/">companion website</a> provides a complete description of the various configuration options, and examples of how to achieve different linking objectives.</li>

<p>The example shows the flexibility of Splink, and how various types of configuration can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How should different data fields be compared?</strong> In this example, the Jaro-Winkler distance is used for names, whereas Levenshtein is used for date of birth since Jaro-Winkler is not appropriate for numeric data.</li>
<li><strong>What blocking rules should be used?</strong> Blocking rules are the primary determinants of how fast Splink will run, but there is a trade off between speed and accuracy. In this case, the input data is small, so the blocking rules are loose.</li>
<li><strong>How should the model parameters be estimated?</strong> In this case, the user has no labels for supervised training, and so uses the unsupervised Expectation Maximisation approach.</li>
<li><strong>Is clustering needed?</strong> In this case, each person may potentially have many duplicates, so clustering is used. This creates an estimated (synthetic) unique identifier for each entity (person) in the input dataset.</li>
</ul>

<p>Incarcerated youth are an exceptionally vulnerable population, and body-worn cameras are an important tool of accountability both for those incarcerated and the staff who supervise them. In 2018 the Texas Juvenile Justice Department (TJJD) deployed body-worn cameras for the first time, and this is a case study of how the agency developed a methodology for measuring the success of the camera rollout. This is also a case study of analysis failure, as it became clear that real-world implementation problems were corrupting the data and rendering the methodology unusable. However, the process of working through the causes of this failure helped the agency identify previously unrecognized problems and ultimately proved to be of great benefit. The purpose of this case study is to demonstrate how negative findings can still be incredibly useful in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Body-worn cameras became a standard tool of policing in the US in the mid-2010s. By recording officer interactions with the public, law enforcement agencies could achieve a greater degree of accountability. Not only could credible claims of police abuse against civilians be easily verified, the argument went, but false accusations would decline as well, saving law enforcement agencies time and resources that would otherwise be wasted on spurious allegations. Initial studies seemed to support this argument.</p>
<p>TJJD faced similar issues to law enforcement agencies, and body-worn cameras seemed like they could be a useful tool. Secure youth residential facilities in Texas all had overhead cameras, but these were very old (they still ran on tape) and captured no audio. This presented a number of problems when it came to deciphering contested incidents, not to mention that these cameras had clearly not prevented any of the agency’s prior scandals from taking place. TJJD received special funding from the legislature to roll out body-worn cameras system-wide, and all juvenile correctional officers were required to wear one.</p>
</div>

<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>From the outset of the rollout of body-worn cameras, TJJD faced a major issue with implementation: in 2019, body worn cameras were an established tool for law enforcement, but there was very little literature or best practice to draw from for their use in a correctional environment. Unlike police officers, juvenile correctional officers (JCOs) deal directly with their charges for virtually their entire shift. In an eight-hour shift, a police officer might record a few calls and traffic stops. A juvenile correctional officer, on the other hand, would record for almost eight consecutive hours. And, because TJJD recorded round-the-clock for hundreds of employees at a time, this added up very quickly to <em>a lot</em> of footage.</p>
<p>For example, a typical dorm in a correctional center might have four JCOs assigned to it. Across a single week, these four JCOs would be expected to record at least 160 hours of footage.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<div class="figure-caption" style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Four JCOs x 40 hours per week = 160 hours of footage.</p>
</div>
<p>This was replicated across every dorm. Three dorms, for example, would produce nearly 500 hours of footage, as seen below.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<div class="figure-caption" style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Three dorms x four JCOs x 40 hours per week = 480 hours of footage.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, we had more than one facility. Four facilities with three dorms each would produce nearly 2,000 hours of footage every week.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<div class="figure-caption" style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Four facilities x three dorms x four JCOs x 40 hours per week = 1,960 hours of footage.</p>
</div>
<p>In actuality, we had a total of five facilities each with over a dozen dorms producing an anticipated <strong>17,000 hours</strong> of footage every week – an impossible amount to monitor manually.</p>
<p>As a result, footage review had to be done in a limited, reactive manner. If our monitoring team received an incident report, they could easily zero in on the cameras of the officers involved and review the incident accordingly. But our executive team had hoped to be able to use the footage proactively, looking for “red flags” in order to <em>prevent</em> potential abuses instead of only responding to allegations.</p>
<p>Because the agency had no way of automating the monitoring of footage, any proactive analysis had to be metadata-based. But what to look for in the metadata? Once again, the lack of best-practice literature left us in the lurch. So, we brainstormed ideas for “red flags” and came up with the following that could be screened for using camera metadata:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Minimal quantity of footage</strong> – our camera policy required correctional officers to have their cameras on at all times in the presence of youth. No footage meant they weren’t using their cameras.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Frequently turning the camera on and off</strong> – a correctional officer working a dorm should have their cameras always on when around youth and not be turning them on and off repeatedly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Large gaps between clips</strong> – it defeats the purpose of having cameras if they’re not turned on.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, we came up with a fourth red flag, which could be screened for by comparing camera metadata with shift-tracking metadata:</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Mismatch between clips recorded and shifts worked</strong> – the agency had very recently rolled out a new shift tracking software. We should expect to see the hours logged by the body cameras roughly match the shift hours worked.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-part-1-quality-control-and-footage-analysis">Analysis, part 1: Quality control and footage analysis</h2>
<p>For this analysis, I gathered the most recent three weeks of body-worn camera data – which, at the time, covered April 1–21, 2019. I also pulled data from Shifthound (our shift management software) covering the same time period. Finally, I gathered HR data from CAPPS, the system that most of the State of Texas used at the time for personnel management and finance.<sup>1</sup> I then performed some quality control work, summarized in the dropdown box below.</p>

<p><code>SkimR</code> is a helpful <code>R</code> package for exploratory analysis that gives summary statistics for every variable in a data frame, including missing values. After using the <code>skim</code> function on clip data, shift data, and HR data, I noticed that the clip data had some missing values for employee ID. This was an error which pointed to data entry mistakes – body-worn cameras do not record footage on their own, after all, so employee IDs should be assigned to each clip.</p>
<p>From here I compared the employee ID field in the clip data to the employee ID field in the HR data. Somewhat surprisingly, IDs existed in the clip data that did not correspond to any entries in the HR data, indicating yet more data entry mistakes – the HR data is the ground truth for all employee IDs. I checked the shift data for the same error – employee IDs that did not exist in the HR data – and found the same problem.</p>
<p>As well as employee IDs that did not exist in the HR data, I also looked for employee IDs in the footage and shift data which related to staff who were not actually employed between April 1–21, 2019. I found some examples of this, which indicated yet more errors: staff cannot use a body-worn camera or log a shift if they have yet to begin working or if they have been terminated (system permissions are revoked upon leaving employment).</p>
<p>I made a list of every erroneous ID to pass off to HR and monitoring staff before excluding them from the subsequent analysis. In total, 10.6% of clips representing 11.3% of total footage had to be excluded due to these initial data quality issues, foreshadowing the subsequent data quality issues the analysis would uncover.</p>
<p>The full analysis script <a href="https://t.ly/BUNRZ">can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In order to operationalize the “red flags” from our brainstorming session, I needed to see what exactly the cameras captured in their metadata. The variables most relevant to our purposes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clip start</li>
<li>Clip end</li>
<li>Camera used</li>
<li>Who was assigned to the camera at the time</li>
<li>The role of the person assigned to the camera</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these fields, I first created the following <strong>aggregations per employee ID</strong>:</p>

<p>Once I established these metrics for each employee I looked at their respective distributions. Standard staff shift lengths at the time were eight hours. If staff were using their cameras appropriately, we would expect to see distributions centered around clip lengths of about an hour, eight or fewer clips per day, and 8-12 footage hours per day. We would also expect to see 0 large gaps.</p>

<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/11/16/images/fig-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Four histograms of key metrics - average clip length, average number of clips per day, average footage hours per day, and average gaps per day."></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>By eyeballing the distributions I could tell most staff were recording fewer than 10 clips per day, shooting about 0.5–2 hours for each clip, for a total of 2–10 hours of daily footage, with the majority of employees having less than one significant gap per day. Superficially, this appeared to provide evidence of widespread attempts at complying with the body-worn camera policy and no systemic rejection or resistance. If this were indeed the case, then we could turn our attention to individual outliers.</p>
<p>First, though, we thought we would attempt to validate this initial impression by testing another assumption. If each employee works on average 40 hours per week – a substantial underestimate given how common overtime was – we should expect, over a three-week period, to see about 120 hours of footage per employee in the dataset. This is <em>not</em> what we found.</p>
<p>Average footage per employee was 70.2 hours over the three-week period, meaning that the average employee was recording less than 60% of shift hours worked. With so many hours going unrecorded for unknown reasons, we needed to investigate further.</p>
<p>Surely the shift data would clarify this…</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-part-2-footage-and-shift-comparison">Analysis, part 2: Footage and shift comparison</h2>
<p>With the data on shifts worked from our timekeeping system, I could theoretically compare actual shifts worked to the amount of footage recorded. If there were patterns in where the gaps in footage fell, that comparison might help to explain why.</p>
<p>In order to join the shift data to the camera data, I needed a common unit of analysis beyond “Employee ID.” Using only this value would produce a nonsensical table that joined up every clip of footage to every shift worked.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take employee #9001005 at Facility Epsilon between April 1–3. This employee has the following clips recorded during that time period:</p>
<table class="table">

<p>We can join this to a similar table of shifts logged. This particular employee had the following shifts scheduled from April 1–3:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">Employee_ID</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Shift_ID</th>

<td style="text-align: left;">2019-04-02 14:00:00</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The table shows two eight-hour morning shifts from 6:00 am to 2:00 pm. We can join the two tables together by ID on a messy many-to-many join, but that tells us nothing about how much they overlap (or fail to overlap) without extensive additional work. For example, we have a unique identifier for employee clip (Clip_ID) and employee shift (Shift_ID), but what we need is a unique identifier that can be used to join the two. Fortunately, for this particular data we can <em>create</em> a unique identifier since both clips and shifts are fundamentally measures of <em>time</em>. While Employee_ID is not in itself unique (i.e., one employee can have multiple clips attached to that ID), Employee_ID combined with time of day is unique. A person can only be in one place at a time, after all!</p>
<p>To reshape the data for joining, I created a function that takes any data frame with a start and end column and unfolds it into discrete units of time. Using the code below to create the “Interval_Convert” function, the shift data above for employee 9001005 converts into one entry per hour of the day per shift. As a result, two eight-hour shifts get turned into 16 employee hours (a sample of which is shown below).</p>

<p>The footage could be converted in a similar manner, and in this way I could break down both the shift data and the clip data into an hour-by-hour view and compare them to one another. Using this new format, I joined together the full tables of footage and shifts to determine how much footage was recorded with no corresponding shift in the timekeeping system.</p>

<p>To summarize what the table is telling us: Almost every employee has footage hours that do not match with logged shifts, totaling nearly 14,000 hours when you add up the Footage_Hours_No_Shift column. But what about the opposite case? How many shift hours were logged with no corresponding footage?</p>

<p>Oh dear. Again, almost every employee has logged shift hours with no footage: 47,000 hours in total. To put it another way, that’s an entire work week per employee not showing up in camera footage.</p>
<p>At this point, we could probably rule out deliberate noncompliance. The clip data already implied that most employees were following the policy, and our facility leadership would surely have noticed a mass refusal large enough to show up this clearly in the data.</p>
<p>One way to check for deliberate noncompliance would be to first exclude shifts that contain zero footage whatsoever. This would rule out total mismatches, where – for whatever reason – the logged shifts had totally failed to overlap with recorded clips. For the remaining shifts that <em>do</em> contain footage, we could look at the proportion of the shift covered by footage. So, if an eight-hour shift had four hours of recorded footage associated with it, then we could say that 50% of the shift had been recorded. The following histogram is a distribution of the number of employees organized by the percent of their shift-hours they recorded (but only shifts that had a nonzero amount of footage).</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>As it turned out, most employees recorded the majority of their matching shifts, a finding that roughly aligns with the initial clip analysis. So, what explains the 14,000 hours of footage with no shifts, and the 47,000 hours of shifts with no footage?</p>

<section id="causes-of-failure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="causes-of-failure">Causes of failure</h2>
<p>Here, I believed, we had reached the end of what I could do with data alone, and so I presented these findings (or lack thereof) to executive leadership. The failure to gather reliable data from linking the clip data to the shift data prompted follow-ups into what exactly was going wrong. As it turned out, <em>many</em> things were going wrong.</p>
<p>First, a number of technical problems plagued the early rollout of the cameras:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All of our facilities suffered from high turnover, and camera ownership was not consistently updated. Employees who no longer worked at the agency could therefore appear in the clip data – somebody else had taken over their camera but had not put their name and ID on it.</p></li>
<li><p>We had no way of telling if a camera was not recording due to being docked and recharging or not recording due to being switched off.</p></li>
<li><p>In the early days of the rollout, footage got assigned to an employee based on the owner of the <em>dock</em>, not the camera. In other words, if Employee A had recorded their shift with their camera but uploaded the footage using a dock assigned to Employee B then the footage would show up in the system as belonging to Employee B.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The shift data was, unsurprisingly, even worse, and it was here we came across our most important finding. While the evidence showed that there wasn’t any widespread non-compliance with the use of the cameras, there <em>was</em> widespread non-compliance with the use of our shift management software. Details are included in the dropdown box below.</p>

<p>Our HR system, CAPPS, had a feature that tracked hours worked in order to calculate leave and overtime pay. However, CAPPS was a statewide application designed for 9–5 office workers, and could not capture the irregular working hours of our staff (much less aid in planning future shifts). We had obtained separate shift management software to fill these gaps, but not realized how inconsistently it was being used. All facilities were required to have their employees log their shifts, but some followed through on this better than others. And even for those that did make a good-faith effort at follow-through, quality control was nonexistent.</p>
<p>In CAPPS, time entry determined pay, so strong incentives existed to ensure accurate entry. But for our shift management software, no incentives existed at all for making sure that entries were correct. For example, a correctional officer could have a 40-hour work week scheduled in the shift software but miss the entire week due to an injury, and the software would still show them as having worked 40 hours that week. Nobody bothered to go back and correct these types of errors because there was no reason to.</p>
<p>The software was intended to be used proactively for planning purposes, not after-the-fact for logging and tracking purposes. Thus, it produced data that was totally inconsistent with actual hours worked, which became apparent when compared to data (like body-worn camera footage) that tracked actual hours on the floor.</p>
<p>In the end, we had to rethink a number of aspects of the shift software’s implementation. In the process of these fixes, leadership also came to make explicit that the software’s primary purpose was to help facilities schedule future shifts, not audit hours worked after the fact (which CAPPS already did, just on a day-by-day basis as opposed to an hour-by-hour basis). This analysis was the only time we attempted to use the shift data in this manner.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-we-learned-from-failure">What we learned from failure</h2>
<p>Whatever means we used to monitor compliance with the camera policy, we learned that it couldn’t be fully automated. The agency followed up this analysis with a random sampling approach, in which monitors would randomly select times of day they knew a given staff member would have to have their cameras turned on and actually watch the associated clips. This review process confirmed the first impressions from the statistical review above: most employees <em>were</em> making good faith attempts at complying with the policy despite technical glitches, short-staffing, and administrative confusion. It also confirmed that proactive monitoring of correctional officers was a human process which had to come from supervisors and staff.</p>
<p>The one piece of the analysis we did use going forward was the clip analysis (converted into a Power BI dashboard and included in the <a href="https://github.com/enndubbs/Body-Worn-Camera-Monitoring">GitHub repository</a> for this article), but only as a supplement for already-launched investigations, not a prompt for one. Body-worn camera footage remained immensely useful for investigations after-the-fact, but inconsistencies in clip data were not, in and of themselves, particularly noteworthy “red flags.” At the end of the day, analytics can contextualize and enhance human judgment, but it cannot replace it.</p>
<p>In academia, the bias in favor of positive findings is well-documented. The failure to find something, or a lack of statistical significance, does not lend itself to publication in the same way that a novel discovery does. But, in an applied setting, where results matter more than publication criteria, negative findings can be highly insightful. They can falsify erroneous assumptions, bring unknown problems to light, and prompt the creation of new processes and tools. In this context, a failure is only truly a failure if nothing is learned from it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/learning/what-is-open-science/#/id/5ab8ea32dd1827131b90e3ac">Open science</a> is about making your research freely accessible to others. This includes your data, your code and any outputs (such as reports or articles).</p>
<p>Many people in research, or working or studying in higher education, will be familiar with open science as a concept. As a lecturer, I was aware of it and frequently made use of open data for teaching and research, but it was not until it became a requirement from my funder that I took the opportunity to run my own research as open science by design.</p>
<p>Most tools that I was already familiar with could be used to support open science, but I soon realised that there were some steps and planning that I first needed to learn. As I discovered more about the processes and principles of open science, I came to see that making my research open would not require much additional time and effort. However, I felt that a succinct guide to open science would certainly help me – and others – to make the transition more easily. So, I set out to write such a guide.</p>
<p>This is the result! It is not meant to be an exhaustive document. Rather, I will explain the route I took to open science and what options are out there for others looking to follow suit.</p>
<section id="what-is-open-science" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-open-science">What is open science?</h2>
<p>“Open science refers to the process of making the content and process of producing evidence and claims transparent and accessible to others” <span class="citation" data-cites="munafo2017manifesto">(Munafò et al. 2017)</span>. The open science principles are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Open source</dt>
<dd>
Any data, code or output is accessible and usable in software that is freely available and with an open license. What this means in practice is that, for example, when sharing data, the .csv format is used rather than .xlsx, as the latter requires closed source software (Microsoft Excel) to run.
</dd>
<dt>Open data</dt>
<dd>
Research data should be freely accessible. One approach to open data is to adhere to the FAIR Data Principles <span class="citation" data-cites="wilkinson2016fair">(Wilkinson et al. 2016)</span>. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, and these principles can be implemented as a step to help make your work open science. However, they are not the only way, nor are they a guarantee that your work will automatically meet the definition of “open science” if you implement them.
</dd>
<dt>Open access</dt>
<dd>
Access to published papers and/or outputs is freely available to all. This can be achieved, for example, by sharing published papers in a pre-print server.

<p>One additional benefit of open science is that it supports <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/06/15/road-to-reproducible-research.html">reproducible research</a>. This means that others can download your data and code, re-run the analysis, and see if they obtain the same results. To get the full benefit of open science and promote reproducibility, code needs to be written with enough explanations or comments to help others understand the logic of the various stages of an analysis.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="steps-to-open-science">Steps to open science</h2>
<p>In this section, I will outline steps you can take to easily make your research open science. There will be situations where it is not possible to make all aspects of research open – for example, due to privacy and consent issues related to data. It is still possible to share some elements of such projects, but potentially this involves additional work – to create suitable demo data, say, or generate synthetic data in order to provide data that has comparable trends but preserves privacy. It may also be possible to share the data when it is requested on a case-by-case basis. I am not going to cover this here, but it is worth considering whether open science is possible in each case.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="before-you-begin">Before you begin…</h3>
<p>Pre-registering an analysis plan for your research helps establish that your research is confirmatory (hypothesis testing) rather than exploratory (hypothesis generating). If you have some hypotheses or research questions that are the foundation of your research, it is worth pre-registering. If your research is exploratory, pre-registration is not necessarily applicable. Although pre-registration in itself is not a requirement for open science, the process of pre-registration can all be completed within repositories such as the Open Science Framework (OSF). Pre-registering your analysis plan will add value and rigour to you research.</p>
<p>If your research doesn’t require pre-registration, jump straight to Step 1.</p>

<p>Does your research plan require you to write a lot of code for analysis purposes, perhaps in collaboration with others? If the answer is <strong>No</strong>, skip to Step 2. If <strong>Yes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider setting up a GitHub repository (or repo), especially if this is a collaborative project and it is likely that more than one person will be working on the code. Don’t forget to invite your collaborators to join the repo!</li>
<li>GitHub repos can be set to private and then made public at the appropriate time, so development work can take place behind closed doors and then released to the wider world when ready.</li>
<li>Ensure that your code is commented properly so that it is reusable and, eventually, your results are reproducible.</li>

<p>GitHub is a great tool for developing code collaboratively, but it may not be right for you – or indeed the only tool to use – if you have a lot of other material to work with and release as part of your research project. If that’s the case:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set up an area for your project on an open science repository such as OSF, Zenodo or Figshare. (If you use OSF then setting up an OSF repository is quick and easy – head to <a href="https://osf.io/">osf.io</a>. OSF allows many integrations, including to GitHub, through the use of add-ons.)</p></li>
<li><p>You can start by setting your repository as private and then make it public at the appropriate time.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload all project files, and don’t forget to invite your collaborators.</p></li>
<li><p>Add ORCIDs for every team member.</p></li>

<p>An ORCID is a persistent digital identifier that you own and control. It allows you to connect your ID with your professional information – affiliations, grants, publications, peer reviews, and more. You can set one up at <a href="https://orcid.org/register">orcid.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you are ready to submit your research to a journal or conference, consider the following steps before you submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that there is enough information in GitHub (if using) and OSF (if using) about the project. This should include instructions for someone to be able to access your files, use the data and run the code.</li>
<li>Make the GitHub and/or OSF repositories publicly visible.</li>
<li>If submitting to a journal that requires anonymous links, generate them and copy them into the manuscript. (In OSF, for example, it is possible to create anonymous links to your repository in case of double-blind submission requirements.)</li>
<li>Share a copy of your manuscript on a pre-print server – but don’t forget to check the journal or conference policy on pre-prints before you do!</li>

<p>This is by no means a complete list but instead features the apps and websites that are commonly used when research projects include data and code.</p>
<section id="open-science-framework-osf" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="open-science-framework-osf">Open Science Framework (OSF)</h5>
<p>OSF is a free web app that supports researchers with sharing, archiving, registration and collaboration. The <a href="https://help.osf.io">Open Science Framework website</a> is worth checking out and includes a guide to help users get started. Once a project is public in the OSF it will have a DOI and a permanent link, so it can be cited. OSF can also support the tracking of versions of your file. One drawback can be that there is a limit on the maximum size of file that can be uploaded.</p>

<section id="figshare" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="figshare">Figshare</h5>
<p>This web app supports storing and sharing research outputs (papers, FAIR data, and non-traditional research outputs). Like OSF, <a href="https://figshare.com">Figshare</a> provides a DOI for your files and is similarly limited in the maximum size of file that can be upload.</p>
</section>
<section id="zenodo" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="zenodo">Zenodo</h5>
<p>Another general purpose open repository. As with Figshare, <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a> also provides a DOI.</p>
</section>
<section id="github" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="github">GitHub</h5>
<p>GitHub is a web app that offers distributed version control. It is very commonly used for software development, especially when there are multiple developers. Although you can share code and many file types through GitHub, accessing and collaborating on projects can be a daunting experience for those who are not familiar with the way GitHub works. Also, GitHub is not always required as it is possible to share your code through OSF, for example. If you want to know more about using GitHub in support of open science and reproducibility, read <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/06/15/road-to-reproducible-research.html">“The road to reproducible research”</a>.</p>

<p>In my case, my project did not involve a heavy amount of coding or a large number of researchers, so I opted to use <a href="https://osf.io/jubv6/">OSF</a> to store the ethics approval documents, the survey questions (which drove the data collection), the data in .csv format, and the outputs. I also then linked this to <a href="https://brunel.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Why_one_size_fits_all_is_not_enough_when_designing_COVID-19_immunity_certificates_for_domestic_use_a_UK_wide_cross-sectional_online_survey/16962895">Figshare</a> from my institution and published the article on <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.12.21264898v2">MedRxiv</a> at the same time as I submitted it to a journal for review. The paper was eventually published in <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/4/e058317">BMJ Open</a>. The steps I took in this case were sufficient for the work to be recognised as embracing open science principles.</p>

</ul>
<p>We sat down with Andy for a quick-fire Q&amp;A to hear more of what’s in store for next week’s event.</p>
<div class="keyline">
<hr>
</div>
<p><strong>The RSS event takes place one day before the UK government’s AI Safety Summit. Why is it so important for statisticians and data scientists to be involved in the debate over AI safety?</strong><br>
Statistics and data science are at the heart of the AI movement – it’s really a question of taking data and information, and using statistical algorithms to create outputs. That’s at the core of what we do as statisticians and data scientists. Although it’s called AI, it uses mathematical and statistical methods.</p>
<p><strong>The AI Safety Summit focuses on risks posed by certain types of AI systems. Where do you see the biggest risk?</strong><br>
Risk depends upon the purpose and the impact of the AI. It’s very different whether something is being used to inform or recommend or persuade or decide. If it’s a decision-making system, say, there is a bigger risk associated with it if the decision to be made will have an important impact on your life – so, that might be a medical decision or a decision on whether you’re to receive benefits or housing, or how you’re treated in the judicial system. It’s important to understand what the AI is being used for and how much control you have over it, and also how much oversight there is. Will the decision be made solely by an algorithm, or is there human oversight?</p>
<p>There is a particular concern moving forward around misinformation and disinformation. That is a genuine concern, particularly with big elections coming up in the UK and beyond. People are sharing things that they don’t realise are disinformation, so it is really important to understand where the information is coming from, its provenance; that’s incredibly important. We’ve seen with hallucinogenic AI that sometimes there are references given for outputs that don’t actually exist. So we need to constantly scrutinise where information sources are coming from and, if sources are quoted, do they really exist?</p>
<p><strong>The <a href="https://rss.org.uk/RSS/media/File-library/Policy/2023/RSS-AI-white-paper-response-v2-2.pdf">RSS policy response</a> to the UK government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper">AI regulation whitepaper</a> urges investment in a Centre for AI Evaluation Methodology. What informed this recommendation?</strong><br>
The white paper uses the word “proportionate” many, many times. When you talk about safety, inevitably you move into the area of risk, and if you want safety measures to be proportionate, and you want those measures to be based upon risk, then – effectively – you have to understand how you evaluate risk, how you evaluate the probability of something happening, and what the impact might be if it does happen. That naturally lends itself to needing to evaluate both the potential harm but also the potential benefit of using AI. I think the summit is focused more around harm, and the concerns around potential harms, rather than the trade off between harm and benefit. But that was certainly the reason we got into talking about the importance of evaluation, and evaluation is used in other industries where there is high risk. Drug development is an example, as is healthcare, where treatments and new methods are evaluated so that people are informed about both the potential harms and the potential benefits.</p>

<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/images/pullquote-purple.png" class="img-fluid" width="50"></p>
<p>We have a really important role to play in focusing attention not only on AI outputs but on inputs. That is an area that hasn’t received enough attention but it is one that statisticians understand incredibly well.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>A lot of the focus of the AI debate is on outputs. Should we be talking more about inputs – the data the models are trained on, where the data is coming from, and issues of quality and bias, etc.?</strong><br>
There should be more discussion of this, yes. Statisticians and data scientists, but statisticians in particular, are trained very much around the data generating process, so we naturally think about how data is gathered, the potential biases in a dataset, and the representation that you need for a study. We understand that the data going in is as important as the outputs produced. And I think it’s becoming more and more necessary to understand where exactly the data is coming from, whether it’s diverse, whether it’s representative of the populations you want to study, and so on. This is an incredibly important area, and provenance of data – like provenance of information – will become ever more important. So, with a large language model, for example, what information is it trained on? Did the developers have permission to use that information? How representative is that information? These sorts of questions need to be addressed, because your outputs will only ever be as good as your inputs.</p>
<p><strong>AI systems are having wide-reaching effects across society. What impact are AI tools having on the work of statisticians and data scientists, and how would you evaluate the impacts so far: good, bad, or neutral?</strong><br>
You have to be a cynic and an evangelist at the same time. There is some very good work being done but also some very naive work. AI is not magic. It requires the same thoroughness and lifecycle management as anything else. Certainly in terms of pattern recognition, image recognition, it’s been very useful. On MRI images, for example, can you reduce the amount of time humans need to spend looking at the data because you have an AI tool helping with the assessment? Of course, the challenge is then, when you have an AI assessment, what do you compare it to? You could compare it to what an expert would assess, but is that a suitable reference point for saying something is a good system, knowing that humans themselves are not perfect? AI systems are able to handle large datasets, large images, very quickly. And so the speed of being able to do that has a potential advantage, although it depends on the level of human oversight. Where we’re seeing these tools being advantageous, I think, is where you have some human oversight but some of the heavy lifting is being done by the AI systems.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope will emerge from the panel debate at the RSS next week? Reaching consensus on such a big, broad topic is unlikely, perhaps, but what are the kinds of things that you’re hoping to learn and take away from the discussion?</strong><br>
We’ve got some very good practitioners on the panel, and I’m hoping that we’ll generate some really good discussion from the panel and some really good questions from the audience. When it comes to the AI conversation generally, there’s a danger that it has focused too much so far on either the academic view of things or the large tech company perspective, so we’re probably missing out a whole tranche of people who are working at the coalface on these things, working in smaller companies. So, I’d like to understand a little bit more about what is happening in that part of industry. I know there’s a big focus on things like building out capability in the UK, and that’s not simply a question of having people with expertise – it’s about having access to things like the right sort of computing environments. So, I think there’s going to be some interesting discussion around what’s holding back industry. Overall, though, what I’d like to see come out of this meeting is a more proportionate response, from people who are working on this on a day-to-day basis. Statisticians are good at that – at coming up with a measured response, an informed response. Do we have the same concerns about the existential threat of AI that have been discussed by some of the larger companies, for example?</p>
<p><strong>Aside from coming along and contributing to this panel discussion, how else can statisticians and data scientists engage with the AI debate and help shape a collective response to this major issue?</strong><br>
I’d certainly encourage them to join the RSS and be a part of our work on this. We want to be a strong voice in the debate on AI because it is underpinned by statistical and mathematical techniques, as I mentioned at the start. We have a really important role to play in focusing attention not only on AI outputs but on inputs. That is an area that hasn’t received enough attention but it is one that statisticians understand incredibly well – and it’s one that brings into discussion issues such as ethics, consent, copyright, etc., and that’s very much where we should be engaging as well.</p>

<p>For years academics have published studies about the limits of automation by AI, suggesting that jobs requiring creativity were the least susceptible to automation. That <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lost-job-chatgpt-made-me-obsolete-copywriter-2023-7?r=US&amp;IR=T">turned</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/02/ai-taking-jobs/">out</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/21/ai-jobs-hollywood-writers-actors-strike">well</a>.</p>
<p>Actually, that’s not completely true: some said that jobs that need a long period of education, like teaching and healthcare, were going to be the hardest of all to automate. <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/khan-labs">Oh</a>. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2023/03/GPT-4_medical_benchmarks.pdf">dear</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, all predictions about the limits of AI have been hopelessly wrong. Maybe we need to accept that there aren’t going to be any limits. How is this going to affect our society?</p>
<p>Studies came out from <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161">Stanford</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh2586">MIT</a> this year, looking at the potential of AI assistants to improve the productivity of office workers. Both came to the same conclusion – that the workers with the lowest ability and least experience were the ones who gained the most in productivity.</p>
<p>In other words, AI has made human knowledge and experience less valuable.</p>
<p>Researchers at Microsoft and Open AI <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13375">wrote</a> something important on this phenomenon that I’d like to quote in full:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Large swaths of modern society are predicated on a “grand bargain” in which professional classes invest years or even decades in technical education and training and are [afforded] the exclusive right to practice in their field, social prestige, and above-average compensation.</p>
<p>Technical disruption of this social contract can have implications not only for the medical field but for numerous other knowledge-intensive professions including law, banking, engineering, accounting, and others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s talk about the fairness of this. Because the AI models didn’t invent medicine, accountancy or engineering. They didn’t learn anything directly from the world – human experts taught AI models how to do these things. And they [the human experts] did it without giving their permission, or even knowing that it was happening.</p>
<p>The large tech companies have sucked up all of human knowledge and culture and now provide access to it for the price of an API call. This is a huge transfer of power and value from humanity to the tech companies.</p>
<p>Biologists in the 1990s found themselves in a very similar position. Celera Genomics was trying to achieve commercial control over the human genome. To stop this happening, the publicly funded Human Genome Project (HGP) resolved to sequence the human genome and release the data for free on a daily basis, before Celera could patent any of it.</p>
<p>The HGP was criticised because of ethical concerns (including concerns about eugenics), and because it was thought to be a huge waste of money. The media attacked it, claiming that a publicly funded initiative could not possibly compete with the commercial sector. Fortunately for humanity, a group of scientists with a vision worked together to make it a success.</p>
<p>And it was a huge success: in purely economic terms it produced nearly $1 trillion in economic impacts for investment of about $4 billion. Apart from the economics, the Human Genome Project accelerated development of the genomic technologies that underlie things like mRNA vaccine technology.</p>
<p>The parallels to our current situation with AI are striking. With OpenAI, just like Celera, we have a commercial enterprise that launched with an open approach to data sharing but eventually changed to a more closed model.</p>
<p>We have commentators suggesting that a publicly funded project to create an open-source AI would be ethically dubious, a waste of money and beyond the competency of the public sector. Where the analogy breaks down is that unlike in the 1990s, we do not have any strong voices arguing on the other side, for openness and the creation of shared AI models for all humanity.</p>
<p>Public funding is needed for an “AI for humanity” project, modelled on the Human Genome Project. How else can we ensure the benefits of AI are spread widely across the global population and not concentrated in the hands of one or two all-powerful technology companies?</p>
<p>We’ll never know what the world would have looked like if we’d let Celera gain control over the human genome. Do we want to know a world where we let technology companies gain total control over artificial intelligence?</p>

<p>Of course. Obviously, there are ethical implications that need to be considered carefully, just as there were for the genome project. At the start of that project, the ethical, legal, and social issues (or ELSI) program was set up. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) devoted about 5% of their total Human Genome Project budgets to the ELSI program and it is now the largest bioethics program in the world. All important ethical issues were considered carefully and resolved without drama.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arent-there-enough-community-efforts-to-build-open-source-ai-models-already">Aren’t there enough community efforts to build open-source AI models already?</h5>
<p>There are good projects producing open-source large language models, like Llama 2 from Meta and Falcon from the TII in the United Arab Emirates. These are not quite as powerful as [Open AI’s] GPT-4 but they prove the concept that open-source models can approach the capabilities of the front-running commercial models; even when produced by a single well-funded lab (and a state-funded lab in the case of the TII). A coordinated international publicly funded project will be needed to surpass commercial models in performance.</p>
<p>In any case, do we want to be dependent on the whims of the famously civic-minded Mark Zuckerberg [CEO of Meta] for access to open-source AI models? We shouldn’t forget that the original Llama model was released with a restrictive licence that was eventually changed to something more open after a community outcry. We are lucky they made this decision. But the future of our societies needs to rely on more than luck.</p>

<p>Absolutely not! The limit of the UK Government’s ambition seems to be to set the UK up as a sort of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-pitch-ai-safety-institute-rishi-sunak/">evaluation and testing</a> station for AI models made in Silicon Valley. This is as far from the spirit of the Human Genome Project as it’s possible to be.</p>
<p>Sir John Sulston, the leader of the HGP in the UK, was a Nobel Prize-winning scientific hero who wanted to stop Celera Genomics from gaining monopolistic control over the human genome at all costs. The current UK ambition would be like reducing the Human Genome Project to merely testing Celera Genomics’ data for errors.</p>

<p>It may not be possible to avoid this. But governments will at least be able to mitigate societal disruption if they can redistribute some of the wealth gained via AI (e.g., via universal basic income). They will not be able to do this if all of the wealth accrues to only one or two technology companies based in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>This summer, the UK Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) published its report on <a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/data-sharing-and-linkage-for-the-public-good/">Data Sharing and Linkage for the Public Good</a>. In the report, the OSR notes that the value of sharing and linking data has become widely recognised within government, though there remain areas of challenge and uncertainties about “the public’s attitude to, and confidence in, data sharing.”</p>
<p>The report also warns that “unless significant changes are implemented… progress that has been made could be lost and the potential for data sharing and linkage to deliver public good will not be achieved.”</p>
<p>To find out more about the report and its recommendations for change, we sat down with Helen Miller-Bakewell, OSR’s head of development and impact. Listen to the full interview below or on YouTube.</p>

<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Hello, I’m Brian Tarran, editor of realworlddatascience.net. And welcome to another Real World Data Science interview. Today I’m speaking with Helen Miller-Bakewell of the Office for Statistics Regulation. And we’re talking about the Office’s July 2023 report, Data Sharing and Linkage for the Public Good. In this report, the OSR reviews progress that has been made towards sharing and linking data for the public good. It says that the value of sharing and linking data has become widely recognised within government, though there remain areas of challenge and uncertainties about, quote, the public’s attitude to and confidence in data sharing. The report warns that quote, unless significant changes are implemented, the OSR is concerned that progress that has been made could be lost and the potential for data sharing and linkage to deliver public good will not be achieved. In my interview with Helen, we talk about some of the key highlights and findings of the report some of its main recommendations, some examples of data sharing and linkage that are going on now within government. So let’s hand over now to Helen, who will begin by introducing herself, her role within OSR and some of the background to the report.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
So I’m Helen, Helen Miller-Bakewell, I have an official title of head of development and impact within OSR. OSR as a whole, our kind of formal job is to regulate statistics produced by government, we are the regulatory arm of the UK Statistics Authority. And our aim is to work towards statistics that serves the public good, and a government that produces and uses statistics analysis in a way that means the public can feel confident in them, and the analysis that that’s done and how they’re used. Within OSR, I used to be a regulator of statistics, I was out there looking at official statistics on crime and security, holding them up against our code of practice for statistics, which sets the standards that we would like to see government statistics meet. In my role now I actually oversee a few of our cross organisation functions, that all are designed to try and improve the way that OSR as a whole works, and to do work that can support the statistical system as a whole. And the most relevant one for today is the data and methods function. And a key piece of work that that function has been working on for the last year is looking at how data sharing and linkage is done across government, and that supports one of OSR’s wider interests and ambitions. One of our ambitions for the current five years is to make greater data available in a secure way for research and evaluation. That’s what this report that we’re going to be talking about has contributed to.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Before we get stuck into the report, maybe it’s worth setting out what does OSR mean when it’s talking about data sharing and linkage? What’s the driver for this being a kind of a priority, something that OSR wants to encourage and to see happen? What are the public benefits that you hope to accrue from it?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
The general premise that’s underpinned the report, and the reason that we have been a champion and advocate for date sharing and linkage for a while, is that we think data can be more powerful when it’s linked, and when it’s made accessible, in a secure way, to a wider audience for analysis. And it can offer more insights and better fulfil its potential to serve the public goods. And again, I keep saying serve the public goods. Within OSR, we very much think that statistics analysis, it shouldn’t just be for government, for decision makers in government, it should be available to the public, to all stakeholders, really, who wants to use it to make decisions hold government to account.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So for people reading this or listening to this, who haven’t yet had a chance to dig into the report – and it’s very interesting report – what are the key messages that you want to share with people? What is the, I guess, what’s the assessment of the current state of data sharing and linkage?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
I think some of the key messages do echo what other reports have said in this space, which is that there really has been some excellent progress in terms of data sharing and data linkage. We last reported on data sharing and linkage back in 2018 and 2019, when the DA was kind of coming into force and things were starting to move slowly.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Sorry to interrupt you. But what is the DEA did you say?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
It’s the Digital Economy Act. So there was some amendments to the DEA, it created new, new powers to enable greater sharing of data for research and statistics, and it put the Office for National Statistics at the centre of those powers. It kind of gave ONS greater powers to ask other departments across the government to share data with them for research and statistical purposes. And the UK Statistics Authority as well have powers to accredit researcher and accredit processing environments so that people can have access to more data as well across governments.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So your last report was in 2018, 2019 time. There’s been good progress, you say, since then. I wanted to ask you about some good examples of data linkage that you’ve seen in that time. Maybe the obvious one is Covid, I’m guessing. The pandemic, that offered a lot of opportunities for linking different datasets together. But are there– is that it? Or are there others that you want to highlight?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
I think the pandemic definitely provided a really strong impetus to share data, to link data. And I think, you know, we saw things done which hadn’t been possible previously, it broke down barriers, and was a kind of an excellent enabler, which is fantastic, because it was a crisis situation. And actually, yes, one of the examples that I would highlight, and I know others in OSR would highlight that was doing Covid, was Office for National Statistics estimates of Covid-19 mortality rates among different ethnic groups, and that drew on census data, it drew on death registration data at your on hospital episode statistics, it drew on data from lots of different places to create some really, really important analysis. It’s exciting to be able to say now that there are good examples of data sharing and linkage across different topic areas and different organisations. And I think if you spoke to regulators in OSR working in different domains, they will each have like their favourite examples of, of data sharing and linkage. Having worked in crime and security regulation myself, the one that comes straight to mind is Data First, which is data linkage project led by Ministry of Justice, working with ADR UK – another one, I don’t have to say full often, Administrative Data Research UK – and that’s done a fantastic job of kind of opening up access again, in a secure way, a real focus on security, to a wealth of data from across MOJ systems, sometimes horrible, clunky legacy systems – I hope none won’t be offended if I say that – but making it valuable because people can, you know, to a greater extent now link it and link it to data from other departments as well.</p>
<p>I did ask a couple of colleagues if they wanted to throw me any other examples of data sharing and linkage that they particularly think highly of, and another one that came up was the Registration and Population Interaction Database, RAPID database, which has been created by DWP [Department for Work and Pensions]. And that provides that brings together data, information from DWP, HMRC [His Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs] and local authorities to try and give a view of citizens’ interactions across the breadth of DWP services. What the report does say is, although we have these good examples, there are still barriers and challenges to doing data sharing and linkage. And that, that can, can be true across the whole process, right from getting support for the idea, through the practical steps of finding out what data is available, where, who owns it, how you can get to it, and then actually doing the linkage bit technically at the end. So we’ve been in a situation where things definitely have improved. But it’s, in many cases, it is not easy or efficient yet to share or link data. Our report talks about different barriers we heard about during the course of interviews with stakeholders, that we’ve encountered through our regulatory work as well. And we make 16 – to be precise – recommendations for how we could, or how government could, could start to chip away at those to, to improve the situation going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Yeah, and I would like to talk about some of those recommendations, I guess the more technical side of the recommendations, a bit, a bit later. One thing I wanted to ask you now about was about a word that sort of jumped out at me in, in the report was this idea of needing there to be a social licence for data sharing. And in the report, social licence has, has been defined as the, like, the level of acceptance or approval in local communities for data linkage projects. Now, I guess for something like the pandemic, right, you can argue that there is a kind of an implicit social licence, it was an emergency situation, there was, you know, people at risk. So that sort of use case was kind of justified, but I was curious about how social licences for these things can best be established and, and maintained, because that’s about kind of interaction with the public, right? You know, you could put a load of government statisticians and data scientists into a room and say, what could you do with this, all this data and how you could, could you link it all together? And they’d get very excited about it? But actually, then, how do you then take that to the public and convince them that it’s a good idea, or are there other ways of making sure this social licence has been obtained?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
So, social licence and public engagement were one of the topics that was good, most consistently mentioned across the interview– interviews we held. And yeah, there just seemed to be a consensus which we would support that those working on data sharing and linkage should be prioritising public engagement around their work, both to kind of gauge the amount of social licence that there might be, or any sticking points, and potentially start to build social licence as well. And I think, you know, it’s really great to see people thinking like that, and I would actually say as well, it seems to be a recurring theme. And it’s really nice to see that having prominence. Another finding from the interviews was, you know, the flip side of this, yes, people think it’s important, but often people can not quite know how to approach public engagement, building social licence. And there are actually a few examples we highlight in the report where we, where we think public engagement has been done, done well, hopefully, to kind of inspire people. I would say, you know, I have a few kind of overarching thoughts on what can be important. And I think it, it comes so much to trust and trustworthiness. And I think the way, some ways that you can support trust with the public are transparency, saying what you’re going to do and why, and how, and actually the outcomes as well, when possible, let’s sit closing the circle. Thinking about this interview, I remembered OSR ran a public dialogue last year with ADR UK. And we were trying to talk to members of the public about what they understand by the public good of statistics and data. And one of the messages that came up there was people want to feel the impact their data and feel that outcome. And they don’t always feel they get that knowledge back. Like, what, what was, so what was the outcome of you having my data and doing these things that you kind of said you would do? So yeah, transparency, and then kind of linked to that, I guess, like continuous engagement, and considered engagement. And the public is not a homogenous group, there will be different groups that are important to engage for different data sharing, different data linkage projects, and you kind of need to consider who are the people you need to really engage with for your specific initiatives. And then it’s, I’m afraid you can’t just do one survey or one focus group, there needs to be some kind of mechanism for getting more continuous engagement to keep an eye on actually, how are people feeling now, because we know that social licence and people’s feelings about sharing data, it can be context dependent, it can be time dependent. And actually the first couple of recommendations in the report, so right there at one and two, number one is about the value of trackers like CDEI’s [Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation] Public Attitudes Survey, which, you know, are run on a semi-regular basis to try and track how the public are feeling at a high level about questions around data. And then our second recommendation is about having an organisation that can do more to produce guidance and support people doing research to do public engagement well.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Does the mission statement of statistics for the public good, does that kind of help guide the approach, right? So any data linkage, data sharing project, you need to understand, you need to think about okay, what’s the public good that we’re trying to achieve here? And then that becomes your, almost the point, the focal point of the discussion with the public about why we want to do this and why we think there’ll be a benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
Absolutely. This focus on the public good is what we always come back to in, in OSR. And again, it is something that can sometimes slightly differentiate us from other organisations in this space where there may be a very internal government focus. Yeah, absolutely. What’s the outcome that’s seeking to be achieved? And will we achieve it? Did we achieve it?</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
One of the parts of the report that I was quite interested in was the four future scenarios. The task you set yourself was to look five years from, from now at where we might be, and I guess give a range of, like, scenarios in which data linkage is great, and everyone’s doing it and it’s fully supported, down to it’s, you know, it’s happening on a piecemeal basis or not at all. So what I wanted to understand was, how those scena– whether any of those scenarios are more likely than others to emerge, and whether the kind of likelihood of those scenarios emerging are dependent on certain of your recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
The scenarios just allowed us to explore in a theoretical way, like, yeah, where, where could we end up? We hope the 16 recommendations we’ve made, taken together, if they could all be fully delivered, could lead us towards that ultimate scenario of data sharing and linkage for the public good. And you can put quite neatly different recommendations against different bits of that scenario to help get, get us there. I think if, if I reflect on the scenarios like right now, the one that feels like most familiar to me is data sharing and linkage in silos. We’ve kind of spoken a little bit earlier already about how there are some areas of government and some topic areas and some organisations that are doing some really brilliant work. And I could see quite a realistic scenario where that kind of becomes more entrenched over, over the next five years. But, you know, maybe that’s actually just realistic, right? Maybe it’s unrealistic to expect that every organisation [in] government with different, different sizes, different funding, different priorities, could, could end up in exactly the same place on date sharing and linkage, all at the kind of, the top level. But I do, I do think if we can chip away at the recommendations we’ve made, then every organisation could improve on their starting point and move towards that, that scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Okay, so let’s talk about some of the recommendations of how we get there. And there were a couple of areas I particularly wanted to focus on. One was talking about career frameworks, and having those kind of reflect, and I guess, reward the skills of those who are working on data and data linkage projects. So I was kind of wondering, you know, are there, are these skills that are kind of currently either underserved or under recognised within the existing career frameworks? And if so, how do we change that? Or was that is that beyond the scope of your report to recommend that?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
I think the situation across government is perhaps relatively complicated here. And I think what we, what we’d really like to see, essentially, is a situation where people in roles, in data roles, basically feel valued, and they can see a clear career pathway for them within government. And I think what we have at the moment is a variety of career frameworks that support people working in in roles with data and a decentralised pay model. Which means pay scales across, across roles can, can – and frameworks – can vary. You can see intuitively, how that has the potential to kind of create confusion for individuals – like well, which career framework should I look at – and, and then on the pay side, the potential to create kind of skills sink, where people want to go and work particular areas simply because they can be paid more, and in some cases it’s a considerable amount more, actually. And the reason I say it’s complicated is because, I mean, to some extent, this, what we have, is appropriate. People who work on data and sharing and linkage projects can come from lots of different analytical backgrounds – like, you could have a statistician or a social researcher or a data scientist or data architect, they could all be working on a, on a data sharing project, shall we say. And actually, it kind of makes sense that people in those kind of different roles might have different career frameworks and paths. And similarly, as I say, pay is decentralised, I don’t think OSR has much power to change too much there. But, you can see there are arguments for departments being able to have their own say on what skills they need to kind of pay more for in different circumstances at different times to, to bolster things. However, what we have said in the report, what we call for, and what we will try and speak to people who own frameworks to try and facilitate, is just a bit more awareness between people who own different frameworks about what else is out there, and a bit more consistency, therefore, about how different data skills perhaps are reflected and where they’re reflected in different frameworks. So we’re not asking for one single framework, I don’t think that would be practical, or particularly serve people working in data very well. But yeah, like more awareness, better joined up working, more consistent use of frameworks in, in job adverts, for example, just to help people see more clarity about their careers and where they can take them.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
I was at an event recently where, you know, people working in, in data science or data, data kind of roles in government, were talking about how, like, the sort of career pathways and that there’s a feeling that technical skills, or growing technical skills aren’t always as well rewarded as greater sort of managerial responsibilities, so that if you become a, someone who’s excellent at being able to solve the, the knotty problems of data linkage and sharing, right, you might not be as well compensated for that as you might be if you were, say, running a team of 20, 30 people and sort of not actually applying those technical skills on a day-to-day basis. So it’s, I guess that was where my question was coming from was, is it that sort of thing that we kind of need to, need to address in some way? But, again, that might be beyond the scope of, you know, what you were looking at it on this particular matter?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
Well, I think it’s something for us to think more about, if I’m honest. We have committed ourselves to a follow on report for this. And we want to kind of take a look at the recommendations next year and see, you know, how far everything’s got. So, you know, any, any additional bits that we haven’t covered in this first report are good for us to think about. I think the situation you’ve just outlined sounds very familiar, to be honest, and not just across data science, across a whole load of roles where, yeah, actually your technical skills, they take you really well to middle management, but then there often comes a point where, if you want to go higher and have greater remuneration, you might have to move more to those softer skills, those managerial skills. That’s something we can think a bit more about, actually. And when we do have conversations with those who we kind of pointed to for the frameworks recommendation, maybe have a look into it a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
This is, I guess, some somewhat related to the previous point. But the other aspect of the recommendations that jumped out to me were the discussion around quality metadata and documentation, standardisation and things like that as being priorities for effective data linkage, these are the things that need to be in place. But again, when you chat to researchers, not just in government but all over the place, these less glamorous aspects of data management are kind of underappreciated. And often teams are, the way that, the way teams work, the way projects work is you finish one, you move on to the next, you don’t really want to think too much about the one that you just worked on, because you’ve got a new priority or a new round of funding or whatever it is. So how do we convince senior leaders that, that there are sufficient resources for this sort of work that needs to be done? It might not sort of deliver necessarily immediate value and benefits, but it’s about kind of accruing the kind of infrastructure, I guess, to, to make sure that data sharing and linkage, you can achieve your, you know, your most optimistic vision of data sharing and linkage being widespread in government.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
Yeah, I think it’s a really important question. And yeah, having worked as a statistician as well, before I came into this world of regulation, yep, I recognise what you just described. And, you know, I think it’s always going to be a challenge in these kind of fast-paced multiple priority environments, where often people are resource stretched in terms of people, time, money, all those things together. Though, I think there’s a couple of tacks. One, I think, is maybe improving the data literacy of senior leaders, and trying to give them a greater understanding of, of data, how it’s used, and around these issues of kind of standardisation, and why they’re why they’re so important. And, actually, a couple of the recommendations earlier on in the report, in the people section, are around improving the– or strengthening the statistical literacy and the data literacy of senior leaders and recommending they go on, for example, the Data Science Campus in ONS run a master class for senior leaders across the service. So I think there was a kind of a bit of a, an education thing. And yeah, I guess, you know, part of that is setting out, like, what are the benefits? And what are the risks of not doing this? I think that, you know, here comes a role for people like OSR in setting expectations, especially in the world of official statistics, it is completely within our power to set the expectation for what government statistics should be doing with regards to metadata, or kind of following, following best practice and things like that. Our code of practice for statistics does do that to some extent already. And us as well, there’s a role for us in demonstrating the benefits and saying why we’re asking people to do these things and, and what’s good when it, when it goes well. I was thinking about this, and it drew to mind the EAST Framework. I don’t know if you’ve come across that. It’s a framework that was introduced to me by the Behavioural Insights Team for bringing about change and what you– what interventions need to be if they’re going to be successful, and it’s Easy, Attractive, Social and Timely. And I think when we and when other organisations who are kind of working on metadata standardisation, like the Central Digital Data Office, like Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, there’s, you know, there’s a few players here. We need to be keeping these, the EAST in mind as we design to try and help people kind of come on board with things more easily. And yeah, recommendation 16 in the report, the final one, is about standardisation and about, there are lots of players in this space and can we, can we bring them together a bit to be even more effective? So that’s, that’s definitely something we’ll be looking at in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
And you said that there’ll be a follow up report soon. When is that? When are you targeting?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
We’re planning next summer. So last time when we did our first report on Joined-up Data in 2018. And then we did a follow on one year on in 2019. We found that was quite an effective way to, for us and others, to kind of build and maintain momentum. And yeah, again, you know, feels a bit unfair almost to just put out a load of recommendations, and then then leave, leave the world to it. We’d like to see if we can help facilitate and then tell people how we’ve been getting on.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
And I’m guessing it’s not, you’re not looking for all recommend– 16 recommendations to be implemented by next year. But it’s, are we making steps towards some of them? Are we are we heading in the right direction?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
You know, let’s practice what we preach. A bit of transparency. Yeah, are we heading in the right direction? And if we’re not, you know, is there a plan? I’d love to be optimistic. That optimistic. I wouldn’t expect that we can just put ticks against all 16 recommendations next year. But hopefully, yeah, we can, we could do some progress bars.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Excellent. Well, we should probably schedule a follow up interview for a year’s time then. But Helen, thank you very much for your time today.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
Oh, you’re very welcome. And if anyone, any of your listeners interested in, in the report, please do get in touch with OSR. We’d be very happy to talk about the report that we’ve just written or about, you know what we’re doing. Following on from that? Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So we’ll definitely put a link to the report in the show notes. So once again, Helen, thank you very much for joining us.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
Oh, you’re welcome. Thank you.</p>

<p>Summer 2023 for us was a blur of excellent data science and statistics events. There was the <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/08/06/jsm-blog.html">Joint Statistical Meetings in Toronto</a>, the <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/08/24/rss-conference.html">Royal Statistical Society Conference in Harrogate</a>, and <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/09/19/positconf-blog.html">posit::conf(2023) in Chicago</a>. But if that wasn’t enough, autumn promises more good stuff, and more opportunities to meet with Real World Data Science in person and online.</p>
<section id="an-introduction-to-real-world-data-science" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-introduction-to-real-world-data-science">An introduction to Real World Data Science</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, October 16, 2023 <strong>Time:</strong> 12 pm – 1 pm <strong>Location:</strong> Online</p>
<p>Next week is Members’ Week at the Royal Statistical Society (RSS), and the RSS calendar is full of events targeted at members – prospective members, new members, and established members. Kicking things off on Monday lunchtime is <a href="https://rss.org.uk/training-events/events/events-2023/rss-events/the-real-world-data-science/">an online event to introduce Real World Data Science</a>. We’ll discuss the aims of this project, our guiding ethos and content plans, and we’ll explain the various ways in which people can contribute to the site.</p>
<p>Chances are, if you’re reading this blog, you won’t need much of an introduction to Real World Data Science. But do please help spread the word to potential new readers, and encourage them to <a href="https://rss.org.uk/training-events/events/events-2023/rss-events/the-real-world-data-science/">register for this free event</a>.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A passion for maths and solving mathematical problems led Niclas Thomas to a PhD in machine learning with a focus on medical research. But then a conversation with a recruiter steered his career towards data science in the retail sphere. After stints at Tesco, Sainsbury’s, and Gousto, Thomas is now head of data science for Next, the clothing retailer.</p>
<p>In this interview with Real World Data Science, Thomas reflects on his career journey so far, from hands-on coding work to team leadership and management. He also argues for the importance of communication and storytelling as part of the data science skill set.</p>

<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Niclas Thomas, thank you for joining us today. I hope you’re well.</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I am indeed thanks. Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Today we’re meeting because we want to find out a little bit about your career in data science, how you got into it, what you’re doing now, where you see both your career and data science as a profession going next. So do you mind– can we start by giving us a brief introduction to who Niclas Thomas is?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, of course. Yeah. So I’m currently working as head of data science at Next. My background is academia originally, a maths degree. I did my PhD in machine learning, and more in medical research, so more of an applied machine learning position where the idea was to try and predict, ultimately, predict disease from a given sample of data from blood – can you actually predict future disease? – which I think is a really interesting area; I love medical research. And then [I] switched over to more commercial role and worked in several retail data science roles: so, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Gousto, and then now, as I said, currently head of data science at Next, where I run a team, and I imagine most listeners will be familiar with what Next do: a retail, a clothing brand on the whole, where the idea is, obviously to sell some great stuff, great products and put the right product in front of the right customer.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Can you tell us, what does your job involve? What are your sort of main tasks and responsibilities in that role?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, so I suppose I’m lucky enough to have been head of data science at several different companies: Sainsbury’s, Gousto, and Next. So it’s always interesting to compare the role of the head of data science in each of those three. At the moment, I think there’s a core focus on, well, ultimately making sure the teams are efficient as possible. And that really means just making sure our tech stack – what tools, what programming languages, what software we use on a day to day basis – is set up for success and make sure the team have what they need to be able to do the job as efficiently as possible, whether that’s using Python or R, whether that’s how we develop code, and how we work with other people as well, being a big part of that, then. So how do we work with other software engineers? How do we work with web developers, then, to make sure that the work we do actually gets in the hands of the business and ultimately in the hands of the customer. So that’s one aspect: it’s just making sure the team is set up for success, both in terms of the ways they work and what tools they have to work as well, then. I guess the other side of that coin is what we actually work on. So understanding the value of potential work we could do, and helping the team understand what that value is, and, and ultimately giving direction of what things we want to work on next. Obviously, that’s not my decision in isolation, but understanding on the one hand, what other stakeholders want to do, what my superiors wants to do, as well. And trying to put that all into the mix to understand these are the next best projects to work on given a finite amount of people to work on these problems. And then ultimately, then, the last part, then, is ultimately helping the team deliver those projects, those products as well then, which usually means calling on my experience of having solved these problems myself, either directly when I was earlier in my career or indirectly through leading others then or, you know, being the head of a team and working with some other great people and to learn from their experiences as well.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
What does data science mean to you, personally? I’m not asking you to define it for everybody. But for you, what is what is data science?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, I wish I’d come up over the years with a great definition of this. But yeah, I mean, really, it just, I mean, at the very highest level, it just means using data to drive business value, I suppose, as I guess in my– which probably reflects the fact that it’s more of a business role that I have. But I think that in its broadest sense, I think that’s true: using data to drive insights and make decisions for the business. There are more, I guess, detailed definitions of that. So, for example, the way I’ve always differentiated between data analytics and data science is that if you want to make repeated decisions on a daily or weekly basis, then that’s when it becomes more about a data science question versus a data analytics question, because data analytics is generally about answering large one off ad hoc questions, rather than making the same decision over and over again and using methods appropriate for that. But, ultimately, that’s what data science means to me, I think: making repeated decisions using data and the scientific method to use data for good.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
And so what do you think is your most important skill as a data scientist given that definition that you have of data science?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
In my role, I suppose communication ultimately becomes the most important thing. I’d say definitely earlier in my career, and I think if you’re the person actually delivering and implementing the algorithm, I think that the technical skill set obviously is really important then. But ultimately, I almost see my role as the head of data science as a hybrid– as a link between my team and the rest of the business, then. So it’s really about being able to, on the one hand, translate technical concepts into non technical descriptions of what we’re actually doing, making sure the rest of the business can understand and vice versa, then making sure I understand the business process and business terminology well enough to be able to translate that for the team, as and when needed, into a vision for a project, a product, then, and develop a strategy for that. So I think that the communication both in the strictest sense of being able to talk that through with, with my team, with other team members, with stakeholders, as well, but also more in the looser sense, then, of being able to define that strategy, being able to define what the roadmap for a particular project or a product might look like.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Can you talk us through your so your education and your training that led up to your kind of first data science job, your first data science role.</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I suppose the first time, the first time I– actually, I’d never heard about it, I think, when a recruiter approached me. This is probably going back into 2014, when I was maybe eight months into my postdoc after my PhD. I think– obviously it did exist before that, although I suppose the terminology wasn’t quite as widespread going back almost 10 years now where the term is a lot more rife. So my original background, I did a master’s in maths originally, four years. And then I remember being– the last year of that, then, I was applying for a few jobs, and I applied for one at the Met Office, where the focus obviously was predicting weather, forecasting. And I wasn’t successful in that job. But I did notice that the, on the job spec at the time, it was PhD preferred was one of the specs on that role. It was probably the first time I thought about taking on a PhD as more of a career move rather than as the natural progression to an academic career, more of a business career move if you like, then of actually how it can help you in more business settings. So that was at least when I decided to do my PhD and thought it’s certainly not going to be– and this was back in 2008, so at the time of the financial issues at the time when getting jobs was harder anyway, so it felt like a win-win of doing something that would be– I was clear I wanted to work in a data role of some sort. And that combined with the fact that I thought it would be a good career move and the financial climate at the time wasn’t brilliant. So I took on a PhD then. And then in terms of actually getting into, into my first data science position was, as I said, just after I finished my PhD, I had been working about six months, eight months as a postdoc, and then a recruiter just described a role that was available at Tesco at the time. And it sounded a lot of what I was doing in my current postdoc role at the time – making predictions based on data and exactly the same techniques – sounded really interesting. And it must have been the way the recruiter sold it at the time as well then, because it’s something I was really keen to take on and then made my move off the back of that then. So yeah, kind of moved into it a little bit, I guess, semi deliberately from taking a PhD on first, but always with the view of moving over to a business role at some point after that.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
But it wasn’t like you started out your further education thinking, “I want to be a data scientist, what do I need to do to kind of get there? What are the subjects I need to focus on? What are the topics I need to research?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, it certainly wasn’t by design at the very start of my journey. I fell in love with math, really, and just fell into data science because of that, really, I loved numbers and loved solving maths problems. So that’s why I did a degree in it first of all, then and certainly, you know, even midway through my degree, then I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do. It was more, as you say, just by chance, then, that there were a few opportune moments that came around then, that opportunities came around at the right time to fall into that career.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Doing a PhD in machine learning as you did, that was quite a – in hindsight – a smart choice of PhD to pursue, I think, right?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I think so. Yeah, I suppose it was– still even at that stage it wasn’t necessarily, again, the terminology ‘data science’ wasn’t really around. Certainly, when I started my PhD in 2009 2010. It wasn’t really terminology, at least it may have been in usage a little bit in terms of being on, you know, if you look for jobs on LinkedIn or Indeed, but it certainly wasn’t terminology that that I would have been particularly familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Your first job in data science was at Tesco. You mentioned that you were you were kind of recruited to that role there. How does it compare to your current role? So I guess, you know, what’s the difference between being a data scientist versus head of data science as you are now?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, I think there are probably more similarities than differences, I would say. We were quite lucky in the setup in Tesco that the recruitment strategy seemed to be more focused around people who already had some experience in, generally, either already had business experience or a PhD. So we were fairly independent in solving our own– the project that we were working on and working on that. Not necessarily with the head of data science guiding us, you know, day by day, in terms of the actual nitty gritty and the technical detail, which is great, then. So it did mean that we had responsibility and ownership for our product quite early on. So yeah, I really enjoyed that. I suppose I was writing a lot more code in those days than I do now. I rarely, if ever write code at the moment. So I think that’s probably true for the last maybe three or four years, I think, only occasionally getting my hands dirty. And even when it is, it’s not really to build an algorithm, it’s more to inquire about what data we have to solve the algorithm then. So even when I do get my hands dirty, it’s more in the very early stages of the whole algorithm development lifecycle. So I think that’s probably the biggest difference is just the actual ownership of development there – probably expected, I would say, but it’s– I think that’s one of the beauties of being in your first job or two in data science. I think the– I think in most places I’ve seen, I think you’ll get ownership of, of the work, the stuff that you work on, on a day to day basis, quite early on. And you’ll be expected to contribute code and ideas for that as well, which I think most people would love. I certainly loved it at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
What was the most important thing you learned in your first year in that job?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I think, again, it’s probably a lot around the ways of working, I would say – of the various ways you can [work], which I never really thought about it before. Working in academia, it was quite isolated, I suppose. You work on your own project, you work on your own work and don’t really– or at least, I found I didn’t really work with anyone else that much. Maybe that was the nature of my work as well, we’d obviously be dependent on people working in a lab to get data. But I think the day to day work, I was working quite in isolation, whereas the team aspect of working, I think, was a steep learning curve then – so agile methodology, and everything around that, which was very, very new to me. And the various ways you can do that. I’m generally not someone for overly putting processes in place in a team, only where necessary. But I think there’s some great learnings from that as well. It certainly started to shape how I think I would want to run a team if and when I got to that position.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So, Nick, what have been your career highlights so far?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I think in terms of– there was one product we built in Sainsbury’s in particular. So in terms of, on a product level of replenishment. So how do you most efficiently get products from the back of the store onto the shelves of an individual store? And what’s the most optimal strategy to do that, which I love for a variety of reasons. A, it was one of the first full data science products that we had deployed and worked on as a team in Sainsbury’s. So there was that kind of milestone about it. I think it also stood out as a really nice move away from classic machine learning – i.e., making a prediction, a classification model – to something that was a bit more operations research based and more based on optimization. So using graph theory, making a graph network of a store. And using that to solve the problem of taking a route through the store, for example, a bit like a Google Maps for a store basically, was how we always pitched it to our stakeholders, and how can you choose the best route and again, moving more into a bit more of a vehicle routing problem, then: if you’ve got two different trolleys, how do you decide what items to put on trolley one versus trolley two? So there’s loads of interesting stuff on the technical side of things and it was, again, I felt it was probably one of the highlights – as well as the end product, it was also the one I worked on at the very start. So actually, the understanding whether it would be possible to do that, what kind of technical approach. So I think certainly from a product perspective, that’s probably stuck in my mind. Aside from that, on a more personal level, I guess, I did decide to write a book off the back of my PhD. Just mainly on my experiences from my PhD and postdoc. I mean, it’s not like a confessional. But more on the– just working with non data scientists and making it more accessible was really what I really focused on there. So having worked with clinicians, immunologists and others as part of the medical research that I did, I felt that data can be accessible if you pitch it in a way and make it easy to use. And so that was the purpose of what was largely an educational textbook.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Do you want to give a short plug for the book, what it’s called and where people can find it?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, so it’s, Data Science for Immunologists is the name of the book. It’s available on Amazon. I’m one of the two co-authors on that then. And we do have a website, <a href="https://datascienceforimmunologists.com/">datascienceforimmunologists.com</a>, as well then if you did want to visit and you can either buy the book, there’s a link on that website or just go straight to Amazon and it’s available there.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
This next question, we’ve gone from highlights to lowlights. Have there been any mistakes or regrets that you’ve had along the way in your data science career so far?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
The main mistakes I think I’ve made before is not valuing, A, communication or soft skills, but B, the leadership and management as well then. And I think especially it’s something, when working at Gousto as well that was something that was a big focus of the team and something that I really took from my time there as well was the, I guess, the art of good management and good leadership, you know, what the difference is between the two. So I wouldn’t say there’s any one bang event that’s a mistake or regret, but it’s probably, as ever, it’s probably I would have put more emphasis on it sooner had I known that how important those skills would be.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Yeah, but I think that’s understandable to a certain extent. If you’re coming from, I guess, a role that’s very hands on, doing things yourself, getting into the messy details of a project, it can sometimes be hard to kind of take a step back and adopt more of a kind of leadership, management position, can’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, definitely. I would agree with that. And I think it’s also, I’d probably say for a lot of people starting out, and certainly it was for me, that the technical– the technical aspect is probably why you get into a role in data science in the first place, that you just love solving problems, basically, whether that’s with code or with pen and paper. And so that’s, that’s what you want to do. And getting your mind focused elsewhere away from that is probably not viewed as the most fun thing to do, I probably wouldn’t have, when I was starting out in 2014, 2015, I probably wouldn’t have thought it was as fun or as interesting to do that as I do now, maybe. So I think that’s the other reason why it probably doesn’t get as much focus earlier on in my career anyway, at least, as it probably deserved.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
How do you think your– how do you see your role, I guess, evolving over the rest of your career in data science?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I suppose on a personal level, for me it’s, I’m always thinking of what, 10 years down the line, do I still want to be focused just on data science? Or do I want to be focused on a data role, more broadly? I suppose that’s always the main question to ask. And so by that I mean, looking at data engineering as well, data analytics, and being responsible for a wider group. I think the way the field is going anyway, I think a lot more companies seem to move to vertical management rather than horizontal. So by that, I mean having heads of data in different areas of the business. So rather than having a head of data and a head of analytics, you might have a head of data for certain aspects of the business and another head of data then that’s responsible for both in other areas of the business, then. So either way, I think that the broadening of responsibilities and not just being responsible for data science is probably one way I would see my career potentially moving. At the moment, I love just focusing just on the data science, I’m really happy doing that now. But I think that could be one way that my focus changes in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
What personal or professional advice would you give for anyone wanting to be a data scientist?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, so first of all, the balance between the soft and hard skills. I think I’ve alluded to it before, but the– don’t put too much– I mean, still emphasise on the technical skills are really important, but don’t feel like it’s the be all end all. I think just understanding the softer side of how you communicate, how you tell a story, for example, and storytelling with data, I think is really important. So I’d say that’s probably one focus area. I think that the second would probably, and maybe it’s a harder one to act on, but being passionate, I think, because whenever I’m looking to recruit anyone new into my team, I think it’s as much about understanding what the potential of that person is as is what is their current performance or where their current capability is – how good they could be in the future is arguably more important. And I think a lot of that comes to ultimately someone’s– whether they have a fixed or growth mindset. So by that, I mean, ultimately, do they want to learn or not, and if they really want to learn, as a lot of data scientists do, but if they have a huge passion for or about data science, and wanting to learn about just how to get better – whether that’s a better coder, better at maths, anything around that – then if you have that attitude, I think then it’s, A, you can have a great impact on our team, but B, I think it’s a sign of someone who can be a great performer in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So what do you think will be the main challenges facing data science as a field over the next few years?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I think probably, certainly, currently maybe living up to the hype, I suppose. And matching I suppose the classic Gartner Hype Cycle of, it feels like we’re probably at the stage where there’s a lot of– the hype has been around for a few years of data science now and I think making sure we tackle the right problems, I suppose, is one of the – and by ‘we’ I mean, Next as a business or whatever business we’re working in at the time – I think it’s making sure we’re working on the right things. Because I think a lot of people will be keen to have data scientists as part of their work and the product they’re trying to build. What is the best place to spend our time, and what projects we should be working on most I think is– becomes important then because, as I say, there’s a huge demand for data scientists time, I think, in every company. And so choosing where we spend that time wisely, I think, becomes the key challenge and the important decisions for, especially for a head of data science like myself to make then, to make sure we’re best using the team’s capacity, then.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The first version of Real World Data Science was launched almost one year ago by the <a href="https://rss.org.uk/">Royal Statistical Society</a> (RSS). As we approach our first birthday, we’re delighted to announce that the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/">American Statistical Association</a> (ASA) has become a partner in this project.</p>
<p>ASA shares our goal of developing Real World Data Science as a free and beneficial resource for the entire data science community – one that informs, inspires and strengthens the community by bringing together students, practitioners, leaders, and educators to share knowledge about real-world applications of data science.</p>
<p>The data science profession is geographically and academically diverse. We believe that Real World Data Science can best achieve its goal of being a trusted, go-to resource for all data scientists if a range of partner organisations work together to develop the site and its content, so we’re thrilled that ASA is taking the first step with us towards fulfilling this vision.</p>
<p>Ron Wasserstein, executive director of the American Statistical Association, shared: “We are delighted to be partnering with RSS on Real World Data Science. This is important for our community and serves to further strengthen our valuable relationship with RSS.”</p>
<p>Sarah Cumbers, chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society, commented: “We’re thrilled to have ASA on board as a partner for Real World Data Science. We have big plans for the project and this partnership will help us achieve these by allowing us to reach more of the data science community and strengthen our content offering.”</p>
<p>As part of this new partnership with ASA, we will shortly welcome two ASA members to our <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2022/10/18/meet-the-team.html">editorial board</a>. So, on behalf of the entire – and soon-to-be expanded – editorial board, we’d like to say a huge thanks to ASA for their support and endorsement of Real World Data Science.</p>
<p>ASA members, groups, and sections interested in contributing to the site are encouraged to review our <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/contributor-docs/call-for-contributions.html">call for contributions</a> and to <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/contact.html">contact us</a> via email or our social media channels to discuss content ideas.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-data-confusion-to-data-intelligence">From data confusion to data intelligence</h3>
<p>An inspiring start to posit::conf(2023) this morning, with keynote talks from Elaine McVey, senior director of analytics at Chief, and David Meza, head of analytics for human capital at NASA, sharing stories and insights on how to build strong data science foundations in organisations.</p>
<p>McVey spoke about the frequent mismatch between high levels of hope for what data science can achieve within organisations, and low levels of understanding about how to set up data science teams for success. The best chance for success, she said, is if data scientists take the lead in helping organisations learn how to make best use of data science expertise.</p>
<p>From there, McVey went on to present a set of “guerilla data science tactics” that data scientists can use to get around any obstacles they may encounter, as illustrated in the slide below:</p>

<p>Data scientists should start by scanning for opportunities to help the organisation, before building a small-scale version of what it is they propose to do. Once buy-in is achieved, and data is made available, it’s time to run with the project. Once complete, you need to “nail the landing,” McVey said, and make sure to communicate results broadly – not just to primary stakeholders, but across the organisation. Then comes time to “up the ante”: if your first project has built some organisational goodwill, leverage that and look for something higher risk, with higher potential reward for the organisation.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, McVey said, data scientists should be building foundations for future projects – creating data pipelines, R packages, etc., that can be reused later. This was a point picked up and developed upon by Meza, who walked through in detail the steps required to establish “data foundations” within organisations, drawing on his own past experiences. Typically, he said, organisations seem to collect data just to store it – but always data should be collected, stored, and managed with analysis in mind.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-hackers-guide-to-open-source-llms">A hacker’s guide to open source LLMs</h3>
<p>Fast.ai’s Jeremy Howard lifted the hood on large language models (LLMs) in the second of two keynotes this morning.</p>
<p>Beginning with an accessible overview of what LLMs are, how they work, and how they are trained, Howard then addressed some of the criticisms made of LLMs – that they “can’t reason” or give correct answers.</p>
<p>As Howard explained, a model like OpenAI’s GPT-4 is not trained at any point to give correct answers to prompts – only to predict the most likely next word, or word token, in a sequence.</p>
<p>The pre-training step, for example, does not involve only feeding the model with “correct answers,” instead relying on a corpus of text from the internet – some (or, maybe, much) of which may consist of factual inaccuracies, errors, falsehoods, etc. And in the fine-tuning stage, when human feedback is used to either reward or penalise model outputs, Howard said there is a preference for confident-sounding responses – and so, again, this doesn’t necessarily reward the model for giving correct answers.</p>
<p>Howard made the case that users have to help language models to give good answers, and that custom instructions can be used to change the way models respond. He then walked delegates through a series of demos using open-source LLMs, to show how outputs can be refined and improved.</p>
<p>“My view is that if you are going to be good at language modelling in any way,” said Howard, “you have to be good at using language models.”</p>

<section id="documenting-things-openly-for-future-us" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="documenting-things-openly-for-future-us">Documenting Things: Openly for Future Us</h3>
<p>Julia Stewart Lowndes, founding director of <a href="https://openscapes.org/">Openscapes</a>, gave a compelling talk advocating for the importance of documentation for data science projects.</p>
<p>Documenting things, Lowndes said, should be done for the benefit of “Future Us”: not only ourselves but our teams and our communities who may be contributing to or revisiting the project in the next hours, days, weeks, months and years.</p>
<p>Documenting things does not have to be painful, Lowndes said. In fact, it’s supposed to be helpful. It does, however, take time and intention. And it means slowing down briefly to write things down now, in order that work speeds up in the longer term.</p>
<p>Lowndes then shared some pointers to help people get started with documentation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have a place to write things down – Google Docs, GitHub, wherever – ideally a place where people can work collaboratively.
<ol type="i">
<li>Develop the habit of writing things down as you go.</li>
<li>Write in a modular way – small bits of text are less daunting and easier to maintain collaboratively.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Have an audience in mind – you are writing this for someone, so make it engaging for them.
<ol type="i">
<li>write in an inclusive tone.</li>
<li>Narrate code in small chunks, and in a way that you’d say out loud if teaching.</li>
<li>Share, and share early – you want to be able to iterate on your documentation and receive feedback. Also, sharing openly does not always mean publicly – manage permissions as necessary.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Design for readability and accessibility.
<ol type="i">
<li>Use section headers – particularly important for screen readers, but this also helps generally to describe the flow of a document. Plus, you can link readers directly to specific parts of a document.</li>
<li>Use text formatting.</li>
<li>Use alt-text for images, describing the take-home message of the image.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teaching-data-science-in-adverse-circumstances-posit-cloud-and-quarto-to-the-rescue">Teaching Data Science in Adverse Circumstances: Posit Cloud and Quarto to the Rescue</h3>
<p>Professor Aleksander Dietrichson of the Universidad de San Martin brought a valuable perspective to posit::conf(2023) on the challenges of teaching data science in the face of technology and language barriers.</p>
<p>At the public, state-funded university in Argentina where Dietrichson works, more than half of students do not have access to laptops or computers at home, and those who do have access – whether at home or at school – may not have access to the latest kit. But “<a href="https://posit.cloud/">Posit Cloud</a> solves the resource issue,” Dietrichson said. The free-to-use, online browser-based version of Posit’s tools runs on anything; Dietrichson said he’s tested it successfully on both decade-old computers and cellphones – though he doesn’t recommend using it on a cellphone!</p>
<p>On language barriers, he pointed out that learning to code in R and Python can be challenging when English isn’t your first language – if you don’t have semantic access to function names, for example, there will be a steeper learning curve for students.</p>
<p>Dietrichson also has to deal with the problem of “arithmaphobia” among some of the liberal arts students he teaches. This has necessitated a reshuffling of the typical statistics curriculum, he said, in order to make it easier for students to access. But the work is worth it, Dietrichson explained: many of his students want to work in careers like journalism, and he believes that “journalists should be statistically literate.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dynamic-interactions-empowering-educators-and-researchers-with-interactive-quarto-documents-using-webr">Dynamic Interactions: Empowering Educators and Researchers with Interactive Quarto Documents Using webR</h3>
<p>Some of my favourite sessions at posit::conf(2023) were about <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>. Understandable, really, when you consider that we used it to build this very site! Albert Rapp has described Quarto as a <a href="https://albert-rapp.de/posts/16_html_css_for_r/16_html_css_for_r.html">web dev gateway drug</a>, and I’d agree with him:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Quarto is a powerful tool for creating beautiful and interactive documents. I think of it as a gateway drug to web development: While it offers a user-friendly interface for creating documents and blogs, it also allows users to delve into the world of HTML &amp; CSS without even realizing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I spoke a bit about my own journey into web dev in one of the Quarto sessions at posit::conf, but what I loved most about these sessions was learning about all the cool new things I’ve yet to discover and try out. For example, <a href="https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/about/">James Balamuta</a>’s talk and demonstration of building interactive code cells into Quarto webpages was an eye-opener!</p>
<p>Since returning from Chicago I’ve tested out this functionality and added Balamuta’s example here. First run the code that’s already in the code block but also edit it to try out your own examples.</p>

<p>Kara Woo, senior data science engineer at InsightRX, began her Wednesday morning keynote with a rousing description of posit::conf(2023) being like a “great community garden” where things are being cultivated and shared for the benefit of all. This is an important feeling, Woo said, because it doesn’t always feel like that in our day jobs. Data scientists can feel siloed, not able to share ideas with like-minded people, and facing resistance from people who say “R can’t do that, R isn’t a real programming language” – a comment that elicited a groan of weary familiarity from sections of the crowd.</p>
<p>But as Woo went on to explain, “it is possible to build quality software in R” and “it is possible to have an organisation where the strengths of R and the people who use it influence the organisation as a whole.”</p>
<p>Woo was speaking from her experience at InsightRX, a precision medicine company, which makes software for clinicians to inform individualised dosing decisions for patients. Through a tool called Nova, clinicians feed in data about a patient’s unique characteristics, which is then passed to R for analysis, which then returns dosage recommendations to Nova.</p>
<p>In InsightRX, R has also been used to solve problems that are not strictly data science problems. Woo gave the example of working with a colleague to write an R package to identify data labels that have been changed and rollout translations for those labels in multiple languages for software users in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>“Our mindset of R being a first-class language empowers us to solve problems,” said Woo.</p>

<p>Hobbies are important, right? They are a way to relax, to unwind. But also a great opportunity to learn things that might come in handy professionally. At least, that is the experience of Meghan Santiago Harris, a data scientist in the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium at Memorial Sloan Kettering.</p>
<p>Harris shared with delegates her journey into generative art, and how skills acquired using ggplot2 for “fun stuff” had a positive impact on her work.</p>
<p>She first defined generative art as artwork created through a program in any language or interface, so long as the program itself executes the generation of the art. To make generative art, Harris said, you just need data and the ability to “think outside the grid” of your favourite graphics software or package. Harris’s tool of choice is ggplot2, but any will do: “If a tool lets you plot data, it will let you make art,” she said.</p>

</div>
<p>Harris’s passion for generative art bloomed during a recent period of maternity leave. She was coding for fun but also deepening her understanding and expertise in areas like code iteration, development and communication. And, in August, Harris published an R package called <a href="https://meghansaha.github.io/artpack/">artpack</a>, which is now available on CRAN and designed “to help generative artists of all levels create generative art in R.”</p>
<p>Generative art was a motivation to learn and do more, Harris said, and doing something she loved helped make programming and data science more digestible.</p>

<p>Following straight after Meghan Santiago Harris was Lydia Gibson, a data scientist from Intel, with an inspiring talk about her route into data science. Gibson began by explaining how, when younger, “I wanted to be a fashion designer.” For her high school prom, Gibson even designed her own dress, which her grandmother made for her.</p>
<p>In 2011, Gibson earned a BS in economics and worked in retail customer service and state and local government for a time before deciding to return to school to do a Masters in statistics in 2021. She had “no experience of programming” when she made this decision, but soon learned that R is “a necessary evil if you have to go back to school to do statistics.”</p>
<p>Gibson told delegates that discovering data visualisation was what made her care about R. She could “feed [her] need for creativity” while also learning about things that were required for her course.</p>
<p>And it was the <a href="https://rfordatasci.com/">R for Data Science (R4DS) Online Learning Community</a> that helped take her learning to the next level. Gibson described R4DS as “an amazing, welcoming learning environment where beginners and advanced folks alike can come together to learn not only R but data science as a whole.”</p>
<p>“Being surrounded by folks more advanced than you is a gift, not a curse,” she said, and she urged delegates to find what they are passionate about and explore its depths.</p>

<p>Tom Mock, product manager for Posit Workbench and RStudio, had a full house for his talk about the upcoming integration of <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub’s code Copilot product</a> into RStudio. Copilot, Mock said, is an AI pair programmer that offers autocomplete-style suggestions for code – and this integration is one of the most popular requested features among RStudio users on GitHub.</p>
<p>To make use of the integration, you’ll need a Copilot subscription from GitHub. But more than that, Mock said, users will need to experiment to learn how to get the most out of the “generative [AI] loop.”</p>
<p>See Mock’s slide deck below for more details.</p>

  <title>‘What if we try to bring R to the classroom? That was our wacky idea’</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://rgirls.org.uk/">R-Girls</a> is an exciting new project launched by Green Oak Academy, a faith-based independent secondary school for girls based in Birmingham, England. The project aims to promote the use of R in schools through the development and delivery of R-based lesson plans for a range of subjects.</p>
<p>To find out more about R-Girls, its origins and ambitions, Real World Data Science met with <strong>Mohammed Mohammed</strong>, a governor at Green Oak Academy, principal consultant for the National Health Service (NHS) Midlands and Lancashire Strategy Unit, and a founder of the NHS-R Community.</p>
<section id="what-inspired-r-girls" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-inspired-r-girls">What inspired R-Girls?</h2>
<p>“It was the confluence of a few different things. Firstly, Dr Razia Ghani, head teacher at Green Oak Academy, has a PhD in mathematics from the University of Birmingham, has some experience of doing statistics in the pharmaceutical sector, and teaches mathematics. That meant we had a lot of shared capital in our background and thinking about things.</p>
<p>“When I became a governor of the school, the staff were doing progress reports for pupils, and I wrote a little programme in R to help them with this. So, that was one of the early uses of R in the school.</p>
<p>“I know R because of my experience in academia, and I had previously put in a proposal to the Health Foundation to introduce R to the National Health Service. The Health Foundation agreed to that, they funded it, and we now have an <a href="https://nhsrcommunity.com/">NHS-R Community</a> which is basically promoting the use of R in the health service.</p>
<p>“And so I said to the head teacher, ‘What about if we try to bring R to the classroom?’ That was our wacky idea, and we put in a bid to the <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/">R Consortium</a>, and they gave us seed funding, and that’s how we got started.”</p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-the-aims-of-the-project" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-aims-of-the-project">What are the aims of the project?</h2>
<p>“The aims of the project are threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>To promote the use of R in secondary schools for girls.</li>
<li>To inspire teachers to incorporate R into their lessons.</li>
<li>To enable students to experience the joy of R.</li>
</ul>
<p>“On our website, we have prepared 10 or so oven-ready lesson plans – they have to be oven-ready for any teacher to ever think about using them; they have to be polished, ready, and easy to use. As well as our website, we have a <a href="https://twitter.com/R_Girls_School">Twitter</a> page and a community on <a href="https://r-girls.slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>
<p>“One key thing to note is that we didn’t set out to teach programming. The history of computer science in our school is that computer science was really not liked at all by the girls. They wouldn’t choose it as a subject to pursue further. So, we decided to use R to support other subjects. This was a key strategic decision, really.</p>
<p>“People have attempted to develop lesson plans to teach Python, but that would be a non-starter in my school because (a) there isn’t much curriculum space, and (b) no teacher is enthusiastic enough to take on that activity and learn Python and become the Python expert in class. Whereas using R as a tool to facilitate learning in other subjects just opens up the whole world of data science in a way that is so much more accessible and appealing. People may say we’re really not teaching students how to code – but we’re not putting them off coding either!”</p>

<div class="figure-caption" style="text-align: center;">
<p>The R-Girls website includes <a href="https://rgirls.org.uk/getting_started.html">tutorials on how to get started using R in school</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="how-is-r-being-used-in-different-subjects-in-school" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-is-r-being-used-in-different-subjects-in-school">How is R being used in different subjects in school?</h2>
<p>“In maths lessons we do things like generate sequences, plot graphs, do Pythagoras’ Theorem. In geography, we have mapping lessons and lessons on plotting rainfall data from Australian cities.</p>
<p>“Our lesson plans are set up in R Markdown, but the key thing from the teacher’s point of view is that they recognise the structure: What stage is it in terms of the curriculum? What are the objectives, the success criteria and keywords? Typically, we’ll show a worked example and then give the students an exercise to draw a different graph, say – they learn to tweak existing code rather than start from scratch.</p>
<p>“We first taught them how to use R using R Markdown – a way of writing script and code and data all together in one document. And after the first lesson, we were absolutely astonished. This is feedback from one of the girls: ‘Today’s lesson was very interesting and exciting. I’ve learnt a lot of new things about coding and found a new hobby…’ From subsequent lessons, here’s more feedback: ‘Programming and coding was actually quite fun… It was a great feeling knowing that I was able to code a whole bar chart all by myself…’</p>
<p>“A new thing that we’ve done recently is that one of the teachers has been inspired and has learned how to build a website in R, and she’s then decided to teach the Year 9 girls how to build their own websites. One quote from a student was: ‘I learnt how to make a website; I feel like an independent woman now.’ Another said: ‘This was very stressful. But it will look good on my CV.’</p>
<p>“One of the key challenges we face in education is that teachers are very stressed, and Covid didn’t help. Workloads are a massive issue in teaching, and of course that’s the same for our teachers. So, we had to make sure that whatever we do does not feel like it’s adding to the workload. One of the things we do is to use R in the cloud, so there is no installation and debugging on local computers. We try to minimise the pain, really.”</p>

<p>“It would be really nice to see that girls introduced to R through the R-Girls project felt there was a natural progression for them to join the <a href="https://rladies.org/">R-Ladies Group</a>, so that data science becomes part of their future aspirations.</p>
<p>“The second thing is that I’d like to set up an annual conference for girls at school, which would be online and which becomes part of the extracurricular landscape, so that any girl interested in R can join.</p>
<p>“We’d also love to see other schools, especially girls schools, joining the project – and joining the project just means agreeing to take the lessons we have and trying them in class. We would welcome other schools contributing additional lessons to the library of lessons, so that it becomes an open community resource that anybody can use. There’s nothing in this which is designed to make it explicitly local to an English independent school in Birmingham!</p>

  <title>‘Pseudo data science’ and other pitfalls: lessons from the UK’s stats regulator on how not to be misleading</title>
  <dc:creator>Ed Humpherson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/posts/2023/09/18/pseudo-data-science.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A typical article on data science hails new data sources, new tools, and new visualisations, and thereby supports the case for the value of data science.</p>
<p>But this article takes a different angle: it talks about potential pitfalls that can face data scientists. It is based on our work as the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), the UK’s regulator for official statistics. We see lots of great work done by statisticians in government. But we also see some of the challenges they face – and data scientists are also likely to encounter the same challenges.</p>
<p>The problems arise from the fact that neither statisticians nor data scientists do their work in isolation. The work usually takes places within organisations – businesses, government bodies, think tanks, academic institutions – and as a result, the statisticians and/or data scientists are not the only players who get to influence how data science is presented and used.</p>
<p>What are the pitfalls we see in our work as regulator?</p>
<section id="pseudo-data-science" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pseudo-data-science">Pseudo data science</h2>
<p>The first type of pitfall is pseudo data science.</p>
<p>Pseudo data science is a term we use to describe attempts to pass off crude work as being more data science-y than it really is. That reflects a sense in public life that data science is new, innovative, somehow the Future. In this context, people who are not data scientists can be tempted to dress themselves up in the clothes of data science to enhance their credibility. This dressing up is usually well-intentioned – communications professionals who want to illuminate and explain complex issues in an engaging way.</p>
<p>The trouble is, it can sometimes backfire. In our work at OSR, we have over the last year seen several examples where organisations have sought to publish visualisations that look like they are the product of in-depth data analysis – when in fact they have been drawn by communications staff using graphic design packages. Examples include <a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-david-pares-treasury-inflation-infographic/">inflation</a>, <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/response-from-sir-robert-chote-to-andrew-gwynne-mp-dhsc-chart-on-nurses-pay/">nurses pay</a>, and <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/letter-to-rachel-reeves-mp-gdp-growth-chart/">comparisons of UK economic performance with other countries</a>. To be fair, whenever we have pointed out issues like this, organisations have responded well, putting in place new procedures to ensure that analysts sign off on this kind of visualisations. Nevertheless, we suspect that the temptations to indulge in pseudo data science will remain strong – and we may need to intervene on similar cases in future.</p>
</section>
<section id="unintelligent-transparency" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unintelligent-transparency">Unintelligent transparency</h2>
<p>The second pitfall is a failure of <a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/regulatory-guidance-on-intelligent-transparency/">intelligent transparency</a>.</p>
<p>There is a raw form of transparency – quoting a single number (a naked number we call it); or dumping data out into the public domain with no explanation. This is not intelligent transparency. The latter involves being clear where data come from, what their source is, and making underlying data available so that others can understand and verify the statements that are being made. Raw transparency and naked numbers treat an audience with little respect; intelligent transparency helps the audience understand and appreciate what sits behind high level claims.</p>
<p>Data science outputs can sometimes seem to communications teams easy to cherry pick for the most attractive number. Again, like pseudo data science, this reflects largely good intentions – to communicate complex things through ideas. But it becomes easy for a single, unsupported number to be used and reused until it loses most of its meaning. We call this weaponization of data, and it is the antithesis of intelligent transparency. And there is a lot of it about – for example the way in which the former Prime Minister of the UK talked repeatedly about <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/sir-david-norgrove-to-prime-minister-employment-statistics/">employment</a>; or <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/response-from-sir-robert-chote-to-alex-cole-hamilton-msp-scottish-renewable-energy-statistics/">claims</a> about Scotland’s capacity for <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/sir-robert-chote-to-stephen-kerr-msp-renewable-energy/">renewable energy</a>. These examples indicate the pathology of weaponization that can impact data science outputs. They also act as a reminder that data scientists can counter weaponization of their own outputs by delivering engaging and insightful communication.</p>
</section>
<section id="context-collapse" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-collapse">Context collapse</h2>
<p>The third type of pitfall surrounds context collapse.</p>
<p>This idea comes from the work of the philosopher <a href="http://lucymcdonald.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Context-Collapse-Online-LMcDonald.pdf">Lucy McDonald</a> (who in turn has built on the ideas of <a href="https://www.danah.org/">danah boyd</a>). What is context collapse? Imagine a swimming pool – with neat divisions of the pool into different lanes. All is clearly labelled – fast, medium, slow – for lane swimmers, who are in turn separated from the splash area for families and the deep end for divers. Removing the lanes, and thus taking away any signposting, increases the likelihood for things to go wrong. The fast swimmers doing front crawl clash with the slower breaststroke swimmers; both are constantly having to avoid the families with young children; and all need to watch for the periodic big splashes created by the divers. This is the online communication environment, in which formerly private and casual statements can go viral; in which a brief statement in a media environment can be picked up on and circulated many times; and in which some bad actors (the divers) may wish to disrupt deliberately the debate by breaking all the rules.</p>
<p>How can this affect data science? It happens when individual bits of data are taken from their context, and used in service of a different, and bigger, argument. A good example is data on Covid vaccinations. Here, UK organisations like the Office for National Statistics and the UK Health Security Agency published comprehensive data in good faith about vaccinations and their impact. Some of the underlying data, however, was taken out of the broader context and used in isolation to support criticisms of vaccines – criticisms that the wider evidence base did not support.</p>
<p>The challenge then became how the organisations should respond. At an organisational level, they did not wish to withdraw the data – because that would reduce transparency. Instead they sought to both caveat their data more clearly; and directly rebut the more egregious misuses of the data. In a sense, then, what began as an individual analytical output became part of a broader organisational judgement on positioning in the face of misinformation.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that, against this third pitfall, there is not yet a clear consensus on how to address it. Practice is emerging all the time and we at OSR continue to support producers of data as they grapple with it.</p>
<p>There are other potential pitfalls to using data science. But what unites these three – pseudo data science; unintelligent transparency; and context collapse – is that they relate to situations where data science rubs up against broader organisational dynamics, around communications, presentation and organisational strategy.</p>
<p>And the meta-message is this: for data scientists to thrive in organisations, they need to be good at more than data science. They need to be skilled at working alongside and influencing colleagues from other functions. Only through this form of <a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/analytical-leadership/">data leadership</a> can the pitfalls be dealt with effectively.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Thinking of contributing to Real World Data Science but not sure how to get started? Help is at hand, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/finnoh">Finn-Ole Höner</a>. The Amsterdam-based business data science student has created <a href="https://github.com/finnoh/RWDS_post_template">a template repository on GitHub</a> that allows anyone to create Real World Data Science content in our house style and format.</p>
<p>In this repository you’ll find two example Quarto (.qmd) documents, which is the main file type we use for generating site content. The “content-brief.qmd” file is a template for developing article ideas to discuss with our site editors, and the “report.qmd” file is a standard article template. Within that article template you’ll find examples of the range of Quarto features that we use, as well as the code you need to make use of them yourself.</p>
<p>These documents can be edited using tools including Visual Studio Code and R Studio. For details on how to work with Quarto documents, see the <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto website</a>. Once article drafts are finished they can be rendered into HTML format, and the output files will be displayed in the Real World Data Science style, thanks to the inclusion of our stylesheets in the template repository. This is a great way for contributors to see what their content will look like on Real World Data Science before anything is published.</p>
<p>To get started, head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/finnoh/RWDS_post_template">RWDS_post_template repository</a> and click the “Use this template” button. Also, be sure to <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/contributor-docs/contributor-guidelines.html">review our contributor guidelines</a> for advice on how to integrate the .qmd templates into the content development and submission workflow.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Finn-Ole Höner for building this valuable resource for Real World Data Science contributors.</p>

  <title>For minorities, biased AI algorithms can damage almost every part of life</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Bad data does not only produce bad outcomes. It can also help to suppress sections of society, for instance vulnerable women and minorities.</p>
<p>This is the argument of <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/is-artificial-intelligence-racist-9781350374423/">my new book</a> on the relationship between various forms of racism and sexism and artificial intelligence (AI). The problem is acute. Algorithms generally need to be exposed to data – often taken from the internet – in order to improve at whatever they do, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/artitifical-intelligence-job-applications-screen-robot-recruiters">screening job applications</a>, or underwriting mortgages.</p>
<p>But the training data often contains many of the biases that exist in the real world. For example, algorithms could learn that most people in a particular job role are male and therefore favour men in job applications. Our data is polluted by a set of myths from the age of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment#:%7E:text=The%20Enlightenment%20included%20a%20range,separation%20of%20church%20and%20state.">“enlightenment”</a>, including biases that lead to <a href="https://www.gaytascience.com/transphobic-algorithms/">discrimination based on gender and sexual identity</a>.</p>
<p>Judging from the history in societies where racism has played a role in <a href="https://sk.sagepub.com/books/racism-from-slavery-to-advanced-capitalism">establishing the social and political order</a>, extending privileges to white males –- in Europe, North America and Australia, for instance –- it is simple science to assume that residues of racist discrimination feed into our technology.</p>
<p>In my research for the book, I have documented some prominent examples. Face recognition software <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use/">more commonly misidentified black and Asian minorities</a>, leading to false arrests in the US and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Software used in the criminal justice system has predicted that black offenders would have <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">higher recidivism rates</a> than they did. There have been false healthcare decisions. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342">A study found that</a> of the black and white patients assigned the same health risk score by an algorithm used in US health management, the black patients were often sicker than their white counterparts.</p>
<p>This reduced the number of black patients identified for extra care by more than half. Because less money was spent on black patients who have the same level of need as white ones, the algorithm falsely concluded that black patients were healthier than equally sick white patients. Denial of mortgages for minority populations is facilitated by biased data sets. The list goes on.</p>
<section id="machines-dont-lie" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="machines-dont-lie">Machines don’t lie?</h2>
<p>Such oppressive algorithms intrude on almost every <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033390-200-the-essential-guide-to-the-algorithms-that-run-your-life/">area of our lives</a>. AI is making matters worse, as it is sold to us as essentially unbiased. We are told that machines don’t lie. Therefore, the logic goes, no one is to blame.</p>
<p>This pseudo-objectiveness is central to the AI-hype created by the Silicon Valley tech giants. It is easily discernible from the speeches of Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, even if now and then they <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">warn us about the projects</a> that they themselves are responsible for.</p>
<p>There are various unaddressed legal and ethical issues at stake. Who is accountable for the mistakes? Could someone claim compensation for an algorithm denying them parole based on their ethnic background in the same way that one might for a toaster that exploded in a kitchen?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://umdearborn.edu/news/ais-mysterious-black-box-problem-explained#:%7E:text=This%20inability%20for%20us%20to,when%20they%20produce%20unwanted%20outcomes.">opaque nature of AI technology</a> poses serious challenges to legal systems which have been built around individual or human accountability. On a more fundamental level, basic human rights are threatened, as legal accountability is blurred by the maze of technology placed between perpetrators and the various forms of discrimination that can be conveniently blamed on the machine.</p>
<p>Racism has always been a systematic strategy to order society. It builds, legitimises and enforces hierarchies between the haves and have nots.</p>
</section>
<section id="ethical-and-legal-vacuum" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ethical-and-legal-vacuum">Ethical and legal vacuum</h2>
<p>In such a world, where it’s difficult to disentangle truth and reality from untruth, our privacy needs to be legally protected. The right to privacy and the concomitant ownership of our virtual and real-life data needs to be codified as a human right, not least in order to harvest the real opportunities that good AI harbours for human security.</p>
<p>But as it stands, the innovators are far ahead of us. Technology has outpaced legislation. The ethical and legal vacuum thus created is readily exploited by criminals, as this brave new AI world is largely anarchic.</p>
<p>Blindfolded by the mistakes of the past, we have entered a wild west without any sheriffs to police the violence of the digital world that’s enveloping our everyday lives. The tragedies are already happening on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It is time to counter the ethical, political and social costs with a concerted social movement in support of legislation. The first step is to educate ourselves about what is happening right now, as our lives will never be the same. It is our responsibility to plan the course of action for this new AI future. Only in this way can a good use of AI be codified in local, national and global institutions.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The Royal Statistical Society International Conference takes place in Harrogate, England, this September (Monday 4 to Thursday 7). Real World Data Science will be in attendance, and we’ve helped organise a couple of sessions we’d like to tell you about.</p>
<section id="evaluating-ai-how-data-science-and-statistics-can-shape-the-uks-ai-strategy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluating-ai-how-data-science-and-statistics-can-shape-the-uks-ai-strategy">Evaluating AI: How data science and statistics can shape the UK’s AI strategy</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 6 September <strong>Time:</strong> 9:00 am - 10:20 am <strong>Room:</strong> Auditorium (moved from Queens Suite 8)</p>
<p>The launch of ChatGPT less than a year ago is a milestone moment in the story of artificial intelligence. Overnight, large language models were transformed from research projects into consumer products, now used by millions each month. <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/07/19/code-interpreter.html">The capabilities are impressive</a>, <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/posts/2023/05/11/chatgpt-data-science-pt1.html">the productivity gains undeniable</a>. But, what of the downsides? These are issues <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2023/04/28/stephanie-hare.html">societies, governments, and individuals are now starting to reckon with</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2023, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper">the UK government published a white paper promising a “pro-innovation approach” to AI regulation</a>, while also acknowledging the risks AI poses to “people’s privacy, their human rights or their safety” and “concerns about the fairness of using AI tools to make decisions which impact people’s lives”. <a href="https://rss.org.uk/RSS/media/File-library/Policy/2023/RSS-AI-white-paper-response-v2-2.pdf">The Royal Statistical Society, in response, has called for investment in a centre for AI evaluation methodology</a>, arguing that users of AI systems should be able to judge the trustworthiness of claims made by AI companies as well as the outputs of their systems.</p>
<p>What should AI evaluation look like? How will it work in practice? What metrics are most important, and – crucially – who gets to decide this? Join us for <a href="https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/4019/program?session=66677&amp;s=700">a special panel debate at the RSS International Conference</a>, where these questions, and more, will be discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 5 September <strong>Time:</strong> 11:40 am - 1:00 pm <strong>Room:</strong> Auditorium</p>
<p>The Royal Statistical Society (RSS) has published a new guide, “<a href="https://royal-statistical-society.github.io/datavisguide/">Best Practices for Data Visualisation</a>”, containing insights, advice, and examples (with code) to make data outputs more readable, accessible, and impactful. The guide is written primarily for contributors to Royal Statistical Society publications – including <em>Significance</em> magazine, the <em>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A</em>, and Real World Data Science – but the information and advice within is also of broad relevance and use for any data visualisation task.</p>
<p>In the first half of this conference session, authors Andreas Krause, <a href="https://nrennie.rbind.io/">Nicola Rennie</a>, and Brian Tarran will introduce the guide and its key recommendations, and there will be a short demo of how to use the new <a href="https://github.com/nrennie/RSSthemes">{RSSthemes} R package</a>. For the second half of the session, attendees will be invited to share feedback with the authors, propose ideas, and start developing new and expanded sections of the guide. Attendees will be shown how to work with the guide’s source files and collaborate via GitHub, so feel free to bring along a laptop and become a contributor!</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://royal-statistical-society.github.io/datavisguide/">rss.org.uk/datavisguide</a> and the <a href="https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/4019/program?session=65937&amp;s=0">RSS Conference website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 6 September <strong>Time:</strong> 5:00pm - 7:00 pm <strong>Room:</strong> Auditorium</p>
<p>We haven’t helped organise this session, but we are interested to see it. Two papers will be presented for discussion and debate. Paper 1 is “Automatic Change-Point Detection in Time Series via Deep Learning” by Jie Li, Paul Fearnhead, Piotr Fryzlewicz, and Tengyao Wang, while Paper 2 is “From Denoising Diffusions to Denoising Markov Models” by Joe Benton, Yuyang Shi, Valentin De Bortoli, George Deligiannidis, and Arnaud Doucet. Preprints of both papers are available now via the <a href="https://rss.org.uk/training-events/events/discussion-papers/">RSS Discussion Meetings webpage</a>, and you can also hear more about the session in this interview with Adam Sykulski, RSS Discussion Papers editor.</p>

  <title>Food for Thought: Third place winners – Loyola Marymount</title>
  <dc:creator>Yifan Hu and Mandy Korpusik</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Undergraduate student Yifan (Rosetta) Hu was responsible for writing the Python script that pre-processes the 2015–2016 UPC, EC, and PPC data for training neural network models. Her script randomly sampled five negative EC descriptions for every positive match between a UPC and EC code. Professor Mandy Korpusik performed the remaining work, including setting up the environment, training the BERT model, and evaluation. Hu spent roughly 10 hours on the competition, and Korpusik spent roughly 40 hours of work (and many additional hours running and monitoring the training and testing scripts).</p>
<section id="our-perspective-on-the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-perspective-on-the-challenge">Our perspective on the challenge</h2>
<p>The goal of this challenge is to use machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to link language-based entries in the IRI and FNDDS databases. Our proposed approach is based on our prior work using deep learning models to map users’ natural language meal descriptions to the FNDDS database <span class="citation" data-cites="7953245">(Korpusik, Collins, and Glass 2017b)</span> to retrieve nutrition information in a spoken diet tracking system. In the past, we found a trade-off between accuracy and cost, leading us to select convolutional neural networks over recurrent long short-term memory (LSTM) networks – with nearly 10x as many parameters and 2x the training time required, LSTMs achieved slightly lower performance on semantic tagging and food database mapping on meals in the breakfast category. Here, we propose to investigate state-of-the-art transformers, specifically the contextual embedding model (i.e., the entire sentence is used as context to generate the embedding) known as BERT <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805">(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, Devlin et al. 2018)</span>.</p>
<section id="related-work" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="related-work">Related work</h5>
<p>Within the past few years, several papers have come out that learn contextual representations of sentences, where the entire sentence is used to generate embeddings.</p>
<p>ELMo <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1802-05365">(Peters et al. 2018)</span> uses a linear combination of vectors extracted from intermediate layer representations of a bidirectional LSTM trained on a large text corpus as a language model; in this feature-based approach, the ELMo vector of the full input sentence is concatenated with the standard context-independent token representations and passed through a task-dependent model for final prediction. This showed performance improvement over state-of-the-art on six NLP tasks, including question answering, textual entailment, and sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>OpenAI GPT <span class="citation" data-cites="radford2018improving">(Radford et al. 2018)</span> is a fine-tuning approach, where they first pre-train a multi-layer transformer <span class="citation" data-cites="NIPS2017_3f5ee243">(Vaswani et al. 2017)</span> as a language model on a large text corpus, and then conduct supervised fine-tuning on the specific task of interest, with a linear softmax layer on top of the pre-trained transformer.</p>
<p>Google’s BERT <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805">(2018)</span> is a fine-tuning approach similar to GPT, but with the key difference that instead of combining separately trained forward and backward transformers, they instead use a masked language model for pre-training, where they randomly masked out input tokens and predicted only those tokens. They demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on 11 NLP tasks, including the CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition task, which is similar to our semantic tagging task.</p>
<p>Finally, many models have recently been developed that improve upon BERT, including RoBERTa <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1907-11692">(which improves BERT’s pre-training by using bigger batches and more data, Y. Liu et al. 2019)</span>, XLNet <span class="citation" data-cites="NEURIPS2019_dc6a7e65">(which uses Transformer-XL and avoids BERT’s pretrain-finetune discrepancy through learning a truly bidirectional context via permutations over the factorization order, Yang et al. 2019)</span>, and ALBERT <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1909-11942">(a lightweight BERT, Lan et al. 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>In our prior work on language understanding for nutrition <span class="citation" data-cites="7078635 7472843 7902155 korpusik17_interspeech 8461769 8721137">(Korpusik et al. 2014, 2016; Korpusik and Glass 2017, 2018, 2019; Korpusik, Collins, and Glass 2017a)</span>, we used a similar binary classification approach for learning embeddings, which were then used at test time to map from user-described meals to USDA food database matches, but with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) instead of BERT. (BERT was not created until 2018, and due to limited memory available for deployment, we needed a smaller model than even BERT base, which has 100 million parameters.) Further work demonstrated that BERT outperformed CNNs on several language understanding tasks, including nutrition <span class="citation" data-cites="korpusik19_interspeech">(Korpusik, Liu, and Glass 2019)</span>.</p>

</section>
<section id="our-approach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-approach">Our approach</h2>
<p>Our approach is to fine-tune a large pre-trained BERT language model on the food data. BERT was originally trained on a massive amount of text for a language modelling task (i.e., predicting which word should come next in a sentence). It relies on a transformer model, which uses an “attention” mechanism to identify which words the model should pay the most “attention” to. We are specifically using BERT for binary sequence classification, which refers to predicting a label (i.e., classification) for a sequence of words. In our case, during fine-tuning (i.e., training the model further on our own dataset) we will feed the model pairs of sentences (where one sentence is the UPC description of a food item and the other is the EC description of another food item), and the model will perform binary classification, predicting whether the sentences are a match (i.e., 1) or not (i.e., 0). We start with the 2015–2016 ground truth PPC data for positive examples, and five randomly sampled negative examples per positive example.</p>
<section id="training-methods" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-methods">Training methods</h5>
<p>Since we used a neural network model, the only features passed into our model were the tokenized words themselves of the EC and UPC food descriptions – we did not conduct any manual feature engineering <span class="citation" data-cites="dong_liu">(Dong and Liu 2018)</span>. The model was trained on a 90/10 split into 90% training and 10% validation data, where the validation data was used as a test set to fine-tune the model’s hyperparameters. We started with a randomly sampled set of 16,000 pairs, batch size of 16 (i.e., the model would train on batches of 16 samples at a time), AdamW <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1711-05101">(Loshchilov and Hutter 2017)</span> as the optimizer (which adaptively updates the learning rate, or how large the update should be to the model’s parameters), a linear schedule with warmup <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1908-03265">(i.e., starting with a small learning rate in the first few epochs of training due to large variance in early stages of training, L. Liu et al. 2019)</span>, and one epoch (i.e., the number of times the model passes through all the training data). We then added the next randomly sampled set of 16,000 pairs to get a model trained on 32,000 data points. Finally, we reached a total of 48,000 data samples used for training. Each pair of sequences was tokenized with the pre-trained BERT tokenizer, with the special CLS and SEP tokens (where CLS is a learned vector that is typically passed to downstream layers for final classification, and SEP is a learned vector that separates two input sequences), and was padded with zeros to the maximum length input sequence of 240 tokens, so that each input sequence would be the same length.</p>
</section>
<section id="model-development-approach" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-development-approach">Model development approach</h5>
<p>We faced many challenges due to the secure nature of the ADRF environment. Since our approach relies on BERT, we were blocked by errors due to the local BERT installation. Typically, BERT is downloaded from the web as the program runs. However, for this challenge, BERT must be installed locally for security reasons. To fix the errors, the BERT models needed to be installed with <code>git lfs clone</code> instead of git.</p>
<p>Second, we were unable to retrieve the test data from the database due to SQLAlchemy errors. We found a workaround by using DBeaver directly to save database tables as Excel spreadsheets, rather than accessing the database tables through Python.</p>
<p>Finally, we needed a GPU in order to efficiently train our BERT models. However, we initially only had a CPU, so there was a delay due to setting up the GPU configuration. Once the GPU image was set up, there was still a CUDA error when running the BERT model during training. We determined that the model was too big to fit into GPU memory, so we found a workaround using gradient checkpointing (trading off computation speed for memory) with the transformers library’s Trainer and TrainingArguments. Unfortunately, the version of transformers we were using did not have these tools, and the library was not updated until less than a week before the deadline, so we still had to train the model on the CPU.</p>
<p>To deal with the inability to run jobs in the background, our process was checkpointing our models every five batches, and saving the model predictions during evaluation to a csv file every five batches as well.</p>

<p>After training, the 48K model (so-called because it was trained on 48,000 data samples) was used at test time via ranking all possible 2017–18 EC descriptions given an unseen UPC description. The rankings were obtained through the model’s output value – the higher the output (or confidence), the more highly we ranked that EC description. To speed up the ranking process, we used blocking (i.e., only ranking a subset of all possible matches), specifically with exact word matches (using only the first six words in the UPC description, which appeared to be the most important), and fed all possible matches through the model in one batch per UPC description. Since we still did not have sufficient time to complete evaluation on the full set of test UPC descriptions, we implemented an expedited evaluation that only considered the first 10 matching EC descriptions in the BERT ranking process (which we call BERT-FAST). We also report results for the slower evaluation method that considers all EC descriptions that match at least one of the first six words in a given UPC description, but note that these results are based on just a small subset of the total test set. See Table 1 below for our results, where the <span class="citation" data-cites="5">(<strong>5?</strong>)</span> indicates how often the correct match was ranked among the top-5. See Table 2 for an estimate of how long it takes to train and test the model on a CPU.<br>

<p>In the future, with more time available, we would train on all data, not just our limited dataset of 48,000 pairs, as well as perform evaluation on the held-out test set with the full set of possible EC matches that have one or more words in common with the UPC description. We would compare against baseline word embedding methods such as word2vec <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1712-09405">(Mikolov et al. 2017)</span> and Glove <span class="citation" data-cites="pennington-etal-2014-glove">(Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014)</span>, and we would explore hierarchical prediction methods for improving efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we would first train a classifier to predict the generic food category, and then train finer-grained models to predict specific foods within a general food category. Finally, we are exploring multi-modal transformer-based approaches that allow two input modalities (i.e., food images and text descriptions of a meal) for predicting the best UPC match.</p>

<p>We recommend that future challenges provide every team with both a CPU and a GPU in their workspace, to avoid transitioning from one to the other midway through the challenge. In addition, if possible, it would be very helpful to provide a mechanism for running jobs in the background. Finally, it may be useful for teams to submit snippets of code along with library package names, in order for the installations to be tested properly beforehand.</p>

  <title>The Food for Thought Challenge: Using AI to support evidence-based food and nutrition policy</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>There’s a saying: “You are what you eat.” Its meaning is somewhat open to interpretation, as with many such sayings, but it is typically used to make the point that if you want to <em>be</em> well, you need to eat well. Nutrition scientists and dieticians spend their careers trying to figure out what “eating well” looks like – the foods the human body needs, in what quantities, and how best to consume them. Their research informs advice and guidance issued by health professionals and governments. Ultimately, though, the choice of what to eat falls to us – individuals and families – and our choices are often determined by our tastes, the availability of foodstuffs in our local stores, their price and affordability.</p>
<p>So, what exactly <em>do</em> we eat? Answers come from a variety of sources. In the United States, there are dietary recall studies such as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a>, which asks a sample of respondents to report their food and beverage consumption over a set period of time. There are also organisations like <a href="https://www.iriworldwide.com/en-gb">IRI</a> that collect point-of-sale data from retail stores on the actual food and drink being sold to consumers. By and large, this information comes from barcodes on product packaging being scanned at checkouts, so it is often referred to as “scanner data”.</p>
<p>This data – from dietary recall studies and retail scanners – is valuable: once we know what people are eating, we can check the nutritional content of those foods and build up a picture of what the diet of a typical individual or family looks like and how it compares to the diet recommended by doctors and policymakers. And, if we know what other foodstuffs are available, how much they cost, and the nutritional value of those items, we can work out how much families need to spend, and on what, in order to eat well and, hopefully, be well.</p>
<p>Figuring all this out is where something called the Purchase to Plate Crosswalk (PPC) comes in. It’s a key tool for understanding the “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157521005445">healthfulness of retail food purchases</a>” and it does this by linking IRI scanner data on what people buy with data on the nutritional content of those foods, as recorded in the US Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS). But there’s a catch: scanner data is collected about hundreds of thousands of food products, whereas the FNDDS has nutritional profile information for only a few thousand items. Linking these two datasets therefore gives rise to a one-to-many matching problem – a problem that takes several hundred person-hours to resolve.</p>
<p>What if machine learning can help? That question inspired a competition, the Food for Thought Challenge, organized by the Coleridge Initiative, a nonprofit organization working with governments to ensure that data are more effectively used for public decision-making. Researchers and data scientists were invited to use machine learning and natural language processing to more efficiently link data on supermarket products to nutrient databases.</p>
<p>This collection of articles tells the story of the <a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/projects/food-for-thought">Food for Thought Challenge</a>. We begin by exploring the <a href="../../../../../case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/01-purchase-to-plate.html">policy issues</a> that drive the development of the PPC – the need to understand the national diet, developing healthy diet plans, and costing up those plans – and the issues posed by record linkage. Next, we learn about <a href="../../../../../case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/02-competition-design.html">the nature of the challenge and the structure of the competition in more detail</a>, and then the <a href="../../../../../case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/03-first-place-winners.html">three</a> <a href="../../../../../case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/04-second-place-winners.html">winning</a> <a href="../../../../../case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/05-third-place-winners.html">teams</a> walk us through their solutions. We end the collection with some closing thoughts on <a href="../../../../../case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/06-value-of-competitions.html">the value of competitions for addressing data scientific challenges in the public sector</a>.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Since 2014, the professional services firm Westat, Inc.&nbsp;has been developing the Purchase to Plate Crosswalk (PPC) for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS). The PPC links the retail food transactions database from IRI’s InfoScan service and the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS). However, the current linkage process uses only partly automated data matching, meaning it is resource intensive, time consuming, and requires manual review.</p>
<p>With sponsorship from ERS, Westat partnered with the Coleridge Initiative to host the Food for Thought competition to challenge researchers and data scientists to use machine learning and natural language processing to find accurate and efficient methods for creating the PPC. Figure 1 provides a visual overview of the challenge set by the competition.</p>

<p>The one-to-many matching task that is central to the competition throws up many challenges for researchers to wrestle with. Because IRI data contains food transactions collected from partnered retail establishments for over 350,000 items, the matchings need to be made based on limited data features, including categories, providers, and semantically inconsistent descriptions that consist of short phrases. Consider this hypothetical example: IRI product-related information about a (fictional) “Cheesy Hashbrowns Hamburger Helper, 5.5 Oz Box” needs to be linked to FNDDS nutrition-related information found under “Mixed dishes – meat, poultry, seafood: Mixed meat dishes”. Figure 2 demonstrates how the two databases are linked with each other to create the PPC. As can be seen, there is no common word that easily indicates that “Cheesy Hashbrowns Hamburger Helper…” should be matched with “Mixed dishes…”, and such cases exist in all IRI tables used for the challenge, from 2012 through 2018.</p>

<div class="figure-caption">
<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Each universal product code (UPC) from the IRI data could match to only one ensemble code (EC) from the FNDDS data, whereas one EC code could match to multiple UPCs.</p>
</div>
<p>Also, because nutritionists or food scientists will always need to review the matching, regardless of the matching method used, it was important that our evaluation of proposed matching methods focused both on the accuracy of prediction models and also on metrics that would lead participants to develop models that facilitate qualified reviewers to reduce their workloads.</p>
<p>Organising the competition was also a challenge in its own right, for data privacy reasons. IRI scanner data contains sensitive information, such as store name, location, unit price, and weekly quantity sold for each item. This ruled out using existing online platforms like Kaggle, DrivenData or AIcrowd to host the competition, and instead required a private secure data enclave to ensure the safe use of sensitive and confidential data assets. The need for such an environment imposed capacity constraints on the competition, meaning only dozens of teams could be invited to take part, whereas on open platforms it is common to have thousands of teams competing and sharing ideas and code.</p>
<section id="competition-structure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="competition-structure">Competition structure</h2>
<p>The competition ran over 10 months and consisted of three separate challenges: two interim, one final. Applications opened in September 2021, and the competition started in January 2022. Submission deadlines for the first and second interim challenges were in July and September 2022, respectively. For these rounds, participants submitted preliminary solutions for evaluation based solely on quantitative metrics, and two awards of $10,000 were given to the highest-scoring teams. The deadline for the final challenge was in October 2022. Here, solutions were evaluated by the scientific review board based on three judging criteria: quantitative metrics, transferability, and innovation. First, second, and third place winners received awards of $30,000, $1,500, and $1,000 respectively. Final presentations were given at the Food for Thought symposium in December 2022.</p>
<p>The competition was run entirely within the Coleridge Initiative’s Administrative Data Research Facility (ADRF), which was established by the United States Census Bureau to inform the decision-making of the Commission on Evidence-Based Policy under the Evidence Act. ADRF follows the Five Safes Framework: safe projects, safe people, safe data, safe settings, and safe outputs.</p>
<p>In keeping with this framework, participants were provided with ADRF login credentials after signing the relevant data use agreements during the onboarding process. All participants were required to agree to the ADRF terms of use, to complete security training, and to pass a security training assessment prior to accessing the challenge data. Participants’ access within ADRF was limited to the challenge environment and data only. There was no internet access, so Coleridge Initiative ensured that any packages requested by teams were available for use within the environment after passing security review. All codes and documentation were only allowed to be exported outside ADRF after export reviews from both Coleridge Initiative and USDA staff. At the end of each challenge, the teams submitted write-ups and supporting files by placing all the necessary submission files in their ADRF team folder. Detailed submission instructions are available via the <a href="https://github.com/realworlddatascience/realworlddatascience.github.io/tree/main/case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/_code">Real World Data Science GitHub repository</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="metrics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>Submissions were evaluated by Coleridge Initiative and technical review and subject review boards based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantitative metrics</strong> were used to measure the predictive accuracy and runtime of the model.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Transferability</strong> measured the quality of documentation and code, and the ability of individuals who are not involved in model development to replicate and implement the team’s approach.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong> measured novelty and creativity of the model in addressing the linkage problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical review was overseen by faculty members from computer science and engineering departments of top US universities. Subject review was handled by subject matter experts from USDA and Westat.</p>
<p>From a quantitative perspective, the most common way to evaluate machine learning competition submissions is to use model predictive accuracy. However, single metrics are typically incomplete descriptions of real-world tasks, and they can easily hide significant differences between models which simple predictive accuracy cannot capture. To select the most appropriate official challenge metrics, Coleridge Initiative reviewed the literature on the use of evaluation measures in both classification and ranking task machine learning competitions. Success at 5 (S@5) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 5 (NDCG@5) scores were ultimately used as the quantitative metrics.</p>
<p>The metrics were applied as follows: models proposed by each team were tasked with outputting five potential FNDDS matches for each IRI code, with potential FNDDS matches ordered from most likely to least likely. S@5 and NDCG@5 scores are broadly similar – both measure whether a correct match is present in the five proposed matches that participants were asked to identify. However, S@5 does not take rank position into account and only considers whether the five proposed FNDDS matches contain the correct FNDDS response. NDCG@5 does take rank into account and also measures how highly the correct FNDDS response is ranked among the five proposed matches. Both measures range from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%). Models get a “full credit” for S@5 as long as they contain the correct FNDDS option. NDCG@5 penalizes models when the correct match is ranked lower on the list of 5 proposed matches.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="technical-description">Technical description</h2>
<section id="environment-setup" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="environment-setup">Environment setup</h5>
<p>Coleridge Initiative solicited technical requirements from participants at the challenge application stage to prepare the ADRF environment as much as possible before the competition began. Each team was asked to share anticipated workspace specifications and software library requests in their application package. From this we identified, reviewed, and installed the requested Python and R packages, libraries, and library components (e.g., pre-trained models, training data) that were not yet available within ADRF.</p>
<p>The setup of graphics processing units (GPUs) was also a critical part of competition preparation. We created an environment with 16 gibibyte (GiB) of GPU memory for each team. Our technology team met with multiple teams several times to discuss computing environment configurations to ensure the GPU could work properly. None of these efforts was wasted: without GPU access, it would be impossible for teams to use state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805">(BERT, Devlin et al. 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>We completed the setup of new team workspaces, each customized to the individual team’s resource and library requirements, including GPU configuration. The isolation and customization of workspaces was vital because teams may request different versions of libraries that potentially have version conflict with other libraries. We ensured the configurations were all set before the challenge began because such data challenges are bursty in nature <span class="citation" data-cites="macavaney_et_al_2021">(Macavaney et al. 2021)</span>, and handling support requests in the private data enclave risked causing delays. We hoped to avoid receiving too many requests in the beginning phase of the competition in order to give participants a better experience, though we did of course provide participants with instructions on how to request additional libraries during the challenge period.</p>
</section>
<section id="supporting-materials" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="supporting-materials">Supporting materials</h5>
<p>In addition to environment preparation, we made available a list of supporting documentation, including IRI, PPC, and FNDDS codebooks, technical reports, and related publications that could help teams understand the challenge datasets. The FNDDS codebook pooled information on variable availability, coding, and descriptions across dataset files and years. It also included internal Westat food category coding difficulty ratings and notes on created PPC codes and provided UPC code, EC code, and general dataset remarks and observations that may take time for analysts to discover on their own.</p>
<p>We developed a baseline model to demonstrate the challenge task and the expected outputs – both outside of ADRF using FNDDS and fictitious data in place of IRI data, and an analogous model using FNDDS and IRI data within the ADRF secure environment. Moreover, we provided the teams with an evaluation script to read in their submissions and evaluate them for predictive accuracy against the public test set using S@5 and NDCG@5 challenge metrics. Finally, we held multiple webinars during the course of the challenge to explain next steps, address participant questions, solicit feedback, and provide general support. Multiple teams also met with our technology team to clarify ADRF-related questions or troubleshoot technical issues.</p>
<p>(Baseline model, toolkits, and evaluation script are available from the <a href="https://github.com/realworlddatascience/realworlddatascience.github.io/tree/main/case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/_code">Real World Data Science GitHub repository</a>.)</p>
</section>
<section id="data-splitting" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-splitting">Data splitting</h5>
<p>To mimic the real-world scenario, the competition used 2012–2016 IRI data as the training set, and the 2017–2018 IRI data as the test set, since the data change over time and USDA could provide the most recent data available. To make sure that models were generalizable and not just overfit to the test set, we split the test set into private and public test sets. In this way, we guaranteed that the models were evaluated on completely hidden data. In order to keep the similar distribution of the two sets, we first divided the data into five quintiles based on EC code frequencies and then randomly sampled 80% of records in each group without repetition for placement into the private test set. Later in the competition, because of the computation limit, we further shrank the private test set to 40% of its original size using the same data-splitting method.</p>
</section>
<section id="judging" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="judging">Judging</h5>
<p>In the first two rounds, submissions were evaluated based on the quantitative metrics, as previously mentioned above. Coleridge Initiative was responsible for running the evaluation script, making sure not to re-train the model or modify the configs in any way, and only applying the model to predict the private test set. Prediction results were then compared against ground truth to get the private scores.</p>
<p>The final challenge was reviewed by the scientific review board on all three judging criteria. Submitted models were first evaluated by Coleridge Initiative in the same way as in the first two rounds. The runtime of models was also recorded as an assessment of model cost. The scientific review boards then assessed the models by the quality of documentation, the quality of code, and the ability to replicate and implement the team’s approach, and scored the models for innovation and creativity in addressing the linkage problem. Lastly, scores were summarized and the scientific review board discussed and decided the winners of the competition.</p>

<section id="lessons-learned" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>It was undoubtedly challenging for teams to work with highly secured data in a private data enclave for this data challenge. We solicited feedback from teams and summarized the issues that we experienced throughout the competitions, together with the solutions to resolve those issues. Below are our main lessons learned and we hope this summary can serve to inform future competitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Environmental factors:</strong> The installation and setup of packages, libraries, and resources, as well as the configuration of GPUs, system dependencies, and workspace design were expected to take a long time as each team had their own needs. To accelerate the process, we requested a list of specific package and environment requirements from the teams in advance. However, due to the complexity of the system configuration required by the teams, environment setup took longer than expected. Thus, the challenge deadlines had to be postponed a few times to accommodate this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time commitment:</strong> Twelve teams were selected to participate in the challenge, but only three teams remained in the final challenge. Other than one team that was disqualified for violating the ADRF terms of use agreement, eight dropped out because of other commitments and insufficient time to meaningfully participate. To ensure security, ADRF does not allow jobs to run in the backend, which also adds to the time commitment of teams. To encourage teams to participate in the final challenge, we gave out additional awards for second and third places.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computing resource limit:</strong> One issue encountered in evaluating submitted models was computing environment resource limits due to the secured nature of the data enclave. The original private test dataset is four times larger than the public test dataset, making it unfeasible to evaluate. To overcome this issue, given the fixed resource constraints, we decided to reduce the private test set to 40% of its original size. It would have been helpful, though, if the competition had set a model running time limit at the outset, so that participants could build simpler yet effective models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Supporting code:</strong> Although the initial baseline model we provided was extremely simple, we found this helped participants a lot in the initial phase – yet there is space to improve. To be specific, supporting codes should be constructed so that all relevant data tables are used and specify the main function to run the code, especially how the model should be tested. The teams only used the main table, which was the only table that was used in the baseline model, for training and did not touch the other supporting table. If we included the other table in the baseline model, it could help participants to have a better use of this data as well. In addition, a baseline model should be intuitive for the participants to follow, allowing evaluators to easily replace the public test set with the private test set without any programming modifications.</p></li>
