Summer 2023 for us was a blur of excellent data science and statistics events. There was the [Joint Statistical Meetings in Toronto](https://realworlddatascience.net/the-pulse/editors-blog/posts/2023/08/06/jsm-blog.html), the [Royal Statistical Society Conference in Harrogate](https://realworlddatascience.net/the-pulse/editors-blog/posts/2023/08/24/rss-conference.html), and [posit::conf(2023) in Chicago](https://realworlddatascience.net/the-pulse/editors-blog/posts/2023/09/19/positconf-blog.html). But if that wasn't enough, autumn promises more good stuff, and more opportunities to meet with Real World Data Science in person and online.

### An introduction to Real World Data Science
**Date:** Monday, October 16, 2023 **Time:** 12 pm -- 1 pm **Location:** Online

Next week is Members' Week at the Royal Statistical Society (RSS), and the RSS calendar is full of events targeted at members -- prospective members, new members, and established members. Kicking things off on Monday lunchtime is [an online event to introduce Real World Data Science](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/events/events-2023/rss-events/the-real-world-data-science/). We'll discuss the aims of this project, our guiding ethos and content plans, and we'll explain the various ways in which people can contribute to the site.

Chances are, if you're reading this blog, you won't need much of an introduction to Real World Data Science. But do please help spread the word to potential new readers, and encourage them to [register for this free event](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/events/events-2023/rss-events/the-real-world-data-science/).

### NHS-R Community Annual Conference
**Date:** Tuesday, October 17, 2023 **Time:** 9:30 am -- 10:00 am **Location:** Edgbaston Stadium, Birmingham (in person) and online

It's a real honour for us to be invited to give a keynote talk at [this annual gathering of the NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/events/nhs-r-community-conference-2023-ticket-for-in-person-attendance-on-tuesday-17th-october-2023/), a group dedicated to promoting the use of R in the National Health Service. Our talk is titled, "Forging community links: NHS-R, the Royal Statistical Society and Real World Data Science," and we'll explain how the Real World Data Science project came about, how we embraced open-source tools and the idea of collaborative content development, and why there's so much to be gained from sharing data science case studies across domains.

### Evaluating artificial intelligence: How data science and statistics can make sense of AI models
**Date:** Tuesday, October 31, 2023 **Time:** 4 pm -- 6 pm **Location:** RSS, London (in person only)

Real World Data Science has partnered with colleagues and volunteers across the RSS to organise another [AI panel debate](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/events/events-2023/rss-events/evaluating-artificial-intelligence-how-data-scienc/#fulleventinfo), following up on the AI discussion at the [RSS Annual Conference](https://realworlddatascience.net/the-pulse/editors-blog/posts/2023/08/24/rss-conference.html).

This event forms part of the [AI Fringe programme of events](https://aifringe.org/), which coincides with [the UK government's AI Safety Summit on 1--2 November](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-introduction).

Our free event focuses on big questions around AI model evaluation, which will also be a key topic of discussion at the summit. One of the government's stated objectives is for the summit to identify "areas for potential collaboration on AI safety research, including evaluating model capabilities and the development of new standards to support governance," and so we'll be asking:

- What should AI evaluation look like? 
- How will it work in practice? 
- What metrics are most important?
- Who gets to decide all of this?

[Register via the RSS website](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/events/events-2023/rss-events/evaluating-artificial-intelligence-how-data-scienc/#fulleventinfo) to attend this free in-person event, chaired by RSS president Andy Garrett. Panellists will be announced soon, so stay tuned!
