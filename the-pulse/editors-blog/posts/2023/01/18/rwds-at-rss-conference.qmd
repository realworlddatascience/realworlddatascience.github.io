Real World Data Science has booked its first conference appearance! This September, we’ll be part of the data science stream of the [RSS International Conference](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/conference-2023/).

Our session, “Real World Data Science Live”, will feature talks and discussions based on content published on this site. In particular, we’re looking to share compelling examples of how data science is being used to solve real-world problems. 

If you’re thinking about [contributing to Real World Data Science](https://realworlddatascience.net/contributor-docs/call-for-contributions.html), or have already made a submission, do let us know whether you’d be interested in taking part in this in-person event. There are only a handful of speaker slots available, so please get in touch ASAP!

The conference takes place 4-7 September 2023, in Harrogate, Yorkshire. [Keynote speakers include Anuj Srivastava](https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/news-publications/2023/general-news/first-keynote-speaker-announced-for-rss-2023-confe/), a Florida State University professor with research interests in statistical computer vision, functional data analysis, and shape analysis, and other [invited topic sessions](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/conference-2023/invited-session-topics/) in the data science stream are:

*	GitHub: Version control for research, teaching and industry
*	Surrogate-assisted uncertainty quantification of complex computer models 
*	Getting your work to work
*	Best practices for the analysis and visualisation of Google Trends data

See the [RSS International Conference 2023 website](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/conference-2023/) for more details.
