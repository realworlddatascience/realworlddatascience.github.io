  description: Well, January seemed to flash by in the blink of an eye - certainly the holiday period seems a long time ago already. All is not lost - the Winter Olympics seems to have crept up on us and is just about to start which will no doubt provide some entertainment and distraction… as I hope will some thought provoking data science reading materials.

  description: Happy New Year! I hope you all had as relaxing a holiday period as possible and enjoyed the fireworks from around the world… London trumps them all as far as I'm concerned although I'm clearly biased. As we all gear up for 2022, perhaps time for some thought provoking data science reading materials to help guide plans for the year ahead.

Rather than dwell solely on COVID related data science topics (of which we know there are plenty) we thought we'd try and bring a more balanced assortment of updates and reading materials this month. We hope these prove entertaining or at least help pass the lockdown hours away.

This will undoubtedly be biased but will hopefully surface materials that we collectively feel is interesting and relevant to the data science community at large.
