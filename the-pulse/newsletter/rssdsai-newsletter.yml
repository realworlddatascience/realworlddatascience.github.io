  description: Another month flies by… still cold, but I've definitely seen the sun once or twice… I hope the on-again off-again dreams of a proper summer holiday aren't proving too painful… perhaps a few curated data science reading materials might ease the burden over the Easter weekend?

  description: Another month flies by… At least it's getting a bit lighter in the mornings and I've even seen the sun once or twice. I hope you are staying as sane as possible despite home-schooling, home-working, home-everything else (delete as appropriate)… perhaps a few curated data science reading materials might lighten the mood?

  description: Well, January seemed to fly by. 2021 has certainly started with a bang (Brexit!, Impeachment!, New President!, Vaccinations!) and the holidays seem an age ago. I hope you are surviving lockdown 3.0 as best as you can… maybe there is room in the long dark evenings for a few curated data science reading materials?

  description: It's hard to believe it's December… in some respects the year has felt incredibly slow as we have watched the pandemic run its inexorable course; and then in other ways it feels like a blur of zoom calls and box sets that has gone by in a flash. Lets hope 2021 proves better… for the time being, how about hunkering down with some 'home-improvement' via a few curated data science reading materials!

  description: Let's face it, July was a bit lacking in sunshine but at least ended with a couple of scorchers. Possibly not the best conditions to be pulling together a newsletter, but we'd always take the sun over rain!

  description: Well, we have made it to summer (at least the British variety) - and it's time for the July edition of our Royal Statistical Society Data Science Section newsletter. Hopefully some interesting topics and titbits to feed your data science curiosity while enjoying a socially distanced day on the beach with everyone else…

  description: Well, April is now behind us, so it is high time to pull together the May edition of our Royal Statistical Society Data Science Section newsletter. Rather than dwell solely on COVID related data science topics (of which we know there are plenty) we thought we'd try and bring a more balanced assortment of updates and reading materials this month. We hope these prove entertaining or at least help pass the lockdown hours away.

  description: We thought it could be useful (and fun) to pick the collective brains of our Data Science Section committee members (as well as those of our impressive array of subscribers and followers) and put together a monthly newsletter. This will undoubtedly be biased but will hopefully surface materials that we collectively feel is interesting and relevant to the data science community at large.
