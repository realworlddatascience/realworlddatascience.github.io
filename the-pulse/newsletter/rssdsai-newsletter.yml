  intro: Well, I don't know about you, but February was a bit of a blur even with the extra day -- we should be used to it now I guess -- certainly less confusing than Julius Caesar's 445 day long 'year of confusion' in 46 B.C. ... Progress of sorts! Definitely time to lose ourselves in some some thought provoking AI and Data Science reading materials!

- title: "February 2023"
  intro: January reminded us (in the UK at least) of the joys of a ‘big coat’ with 2023 definitely off to a cold start… No great change to the depressing headlines though so hopefully time for a bit of distraction with a wrap up of data science developments in the last month.

- title: "December 2022"
  intro: December already… Happy Holidays to everyone! It certainly feels like winter is here judging by the lack of sunlight. But a December like no other, as we have a World Cup to watch - although half empty, beer-less, air-conditioned stadiums in repressive Qatar does not sit well…

- title: "November 2022"
  intro: Another month, another UK Prime Minister it seems - certainly the rate of political dramas doesn't seem to be slowing…

  date: 11/07/2022

- title: "October 2022"
  intro: Well, September certainly seemed to disappear pretty rapidly (along with the sunshine sadly). And dramatic events keep accumulating, from the sad death of the Queen, together with epic coverage of 'the queue', to dramatic counter offensives in the Ukraine, to unprecedented IMF criticism of the UK government's tax-cutting plans.
  href: https://datasciencesection.org/2022/10/01/october-newsletter-3/
  date: 10/01/2022

- title: "September 2022"
  intro: I hope you have all been enjoying a great summer. Certainly lots to engage with from heat waves, sewage spills, leadership elections, spiralling energy costs… and of course on a much more positive note the Lionesses winning the Euros for the first time (it's come home…)! Apologies for skipping a month but it does mean we have plenty to talk about so prepare for a somewhat longer than normal read…

  date: 09/02/2022

- title: "July 2022"
  intro: Welcome to July! Inflation, union strikes, sunshine… lots of commentary drawing parallels to the mid-70s. One thing that is very different from that period is the world of data science (which didn't even exist as a discipline) - crazy to think that the Apple II launched in '77 with 4 KB RAM, 4 million times less memory than the laptop I'm writing this on…

- title: "May 2022"
  intro: Another month flies by, and although we had that rarest of occasions in the UK - a sunny Easter weekend - the news in general continues to be depressing; law breakers at the highest ranks of government, covid infections high, and of course the devastating war in Ukraine. Hopefully the data science reading materials below might distract a little…
  href: https://datasciencesection.org/2022/05/02/may-newsletter-3/
  date: 05/02/2022

- title: "April 2022"
  intro: The news from Ukraine is truly devastating and brings a huge dose of perspective to our day to day lives in the UK. I know I for one care rather less about fixing my python package dependencies when I see the shocking scenes from Mariupol… However, those of us more distant from the war do at least have the option to think about other things, and hopefully the data science reading materials below might distract a little…

  intro: Well, January seemed to flash by in the blink of an eye - certainly the holiday period seems a long time ago already. All is not lost - the Winter Olympics seems to have crept up on us and is just about to start which will no doubt provide some entertainment and distraction… as I hope will some thought provoking data science reading materials.

  intro: Another month flies by… At least it's getting a bit lighter in the mornings and I've even seen the sun once or twice.

  date: 01/04/2021

- title: "December 2020"
  intro: It's hard to believe it's December… in some respects the year has felt incredibly slow as we have watched the pandemic run its inexorable course; and then in other ways it feels like a blur of zoom calls and box sets that has gone by in a flash. Lets hope 2021 proves better… for the time being, how about hunkering down with some 'home-improvement' via a few curated data science reading materials!

  date: 09/03/2020

- title: "August 2020"
  intro: Let's face it, July was a bit lacking in sunshine but at least ended with a couple of scorchers. Possibly not the best conditions to be pulling together a newsletter, but we'd always take the sun over rain!
