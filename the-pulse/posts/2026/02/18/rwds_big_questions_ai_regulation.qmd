AI development is accelerating, while regulation moves more deliberately. That tension creates a core challenge: how do we maintain momentum without breaking the things that matter? The aim isn’t to slow innovation unnecessarily, but to ensure progress happens at a pace that protects individuals and society. Responsible actors should not be disadvantaged — yet safeguards are essential to maintain trust.

For the latest video in our RWDS Big Questions series, our panel explores this delicate balance. From risk-based frameworks and transparency to global inequality in AI development, the conversation surfaces the tensions, trade-offs and practical realities facing policymakers, technologists and data scientists alike.

## Takeaways at a glance

- **Innovation and regulation are not opposites** – both are essential, but difficult to balance.
- **Responsible progress requires proportionality** – not all AI applications carry the same level of risk.
- **Transparency enables better governance** – open dialogue between developers and regulators is key.
- **Risk-based frameworks provide structure** – distinguishing low-, high-, and unacceptable-risk uses helps focus oversight.
- **Global disparities complicate regulation** – some regions are regulating advanced AI systems, while others are still building foundational capacity.
- **Innovation needs protected space** – experimentation, iteration, and even failure are critical before formal standardisation.

## Key themes and analysis

**Proportional regulation through risk**

Not all AI systems pose the same level of harm. A risk-based approach — distinguishing low-, high-, and unacceptable-risk uses — offers a practical middle ground. It avoids blanket restrictions while ensuring stronger oversight where impact is greatest. The debate becomes less about whether to regulate, and more about how proportionate that regulation should be.

**Transparency as common ground**

Openness can bridge the gap between technologists and regulators. Clear communication about capabilities, limitations and risks enables more informed policy decisions. When innovation happens transparently and in dialogue with regulators, governance can evolve alongside technology rather than lagging behind it.

**The global unevenness of AI governance**

AI regulation is developing unevenly across regions. While parts of the West are formalising frameworks, many countries are still building foundational AI capacity. This raises difficult questions about sequencing: should regulation lead innovation, or follow it? A one-size-fits-all model may not reflect global realities.

**Protecting space to experiment**

Innovation requires room to test, iterate and occasionally fail. Early experimentation should not be overburdened with rigid controls — but successful, scalable systems must eventually transition into more standardised and regulated environments. The challenge is designing pathways that support both creativity and accountability.

## Looking ahead

As AI continues to evolve, the balance between innovation and regulation will remain dynamic — and contested. This conversation opens up important questions, and we would love to hear our readers’ thoughts about how we move some of the principles mentioned in the video into practice.

- How do we facilitate transparent channels of communication between those developing AI and those designing the regulatory frameworks that will govern it?
- What should determine whether an AI system is low, high, or unacceptable risk?
- How do we define a “safe speed” for AI development — and who gets to decide?
